7FOREWORD
The increased adoption of Information T echnology (IT), electronic communications, 
and cyberspace – comprising a global network of interdependent information 
technology infrastructures, telecommunications networks, and computer processing  
systems  –  has provided organizations in the UAE with a platform for delivering innovative 
services and stimulating economic development, as well as facilitating collaboration 
and communications among individuals. Our dependence on these technologies will 
continue to grow in the future, and therefore, the UAE Government is committed to the 
development of a secure national information and communications infrastructure for 
UAE organizations and individuals to realize the full potential of its benefits, in the face of 
an evolving set of related cyber threats.
As cyber threats such as hacktivism and cybercrime evolve, so must our efforts to 
defend against them in a coordinated and systematic manner. T o align and direct national  
cybersecurity efforts, the UAE Government created the National Electronic Security 
Authority (NESA) to improve our national cybersecurity, and protect our national 
information and communications infrastructure. As part of this mandate, NESA 
developed the UAE Information Assurance (IA) Standards to provide requirements for 
raising the minimum level of IA across all relevant entities in the UAE.
The adoption of these Standards by UAE entities will sustain the benefits of a trusted 
digital environment for businesses and individuals across the nation. As cybersecurity 
is the shared responsibility of every organization and individual, collaboration and 
partnerships between the Government and private sector organizations are key to 
success. I am confident that our combined efforts will make great strides in achieving 
the UAE’s national cybersecurity objectives and allow our nation’s interests to thrive.

BACKGROUNDUAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 01  Introduction
The adoption of Information Technology (IT) and electronic communication have 
greatly improved the efficiency and productivity of businesses and governments within 
the UAE, and facilitated collaboration of individuals within the nation and across the 
globe. Undoubtedly, IT and electronic communication have and will continue to play a 
pivotal role in the economic development of the UAE and the daily life of its citizens.  
Therefore, the UAE stands committed to the further development of its national IT and 
electronic communication infrastructure, as well as its cyberspace, to support economic 
development and provide an environment where the interests of its governments, 
businesses, and citizens can thrive. 
The benefits of this technology adoption, however, come with a rapidly evolving set of 
cyber threats. These threats stem from a wide range of sources – including hacktivists, 
issue-motivated groups, and organized cybercrime syndicates – and represent national 
security concerns that can potentially disrupt critical national services and compromise 
critical information assets.
Mitigating cyber threats, and ensuring the development of a secure national information 
and communications infrastructure, and cyberspace, is a strategic priority for the UAE. 
To this end, NESA developed the UAE IA Standards as a critical element of the National 
Information Assurance Framework (NIAF) to provide requirements for elevating the 
level of IA across all implementing entities in the UAE.

--- Page 11 ---
121 The process for NESA to designate an entity as “critical” is outlined in the UAE Critical Information 
Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) Policy produced by NESA.
UAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 01  Introduction
The development of the UAE IA Standards is based on regional and global best  
practices including:
•	 ISO/IEC	 27001:2005  “Information technology - Security techniques - Information 
security management systems - Requirements”,
•	 ISO/IEC	 27002:2005  “Information technology - Security techniques - Code of 
practice for Information security management”,
•	 ISO/IEC	 27005:2005  “Information technology - Security techniques -Information 
security risk management” 
•	 ISO/IEC	 27010:2012  “Information technology - Security techniques - Information 
security management for inter-sector and inter-organizational communications”
•	 ISO/IEC	 27032:2012  “Information technology - Security techniques - Guidelines 
for cybersecurity”
•	 NIST	 800-53	Revision	 4 “Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information 
Systems and Organizations”
• Abu Dhabi Information Security Standards Version 1 and Version 2, developed by  
 Abu Dhabi Systems and Information Centre (ADSIC)  
• SANS 20 Critical Security Controls for Effective Cyber Defense Version 4.1
Moreover the development was guide d by key principles including:  
• Applicability of the common IA requirements across industries , and applicability of 
the sector-specific IA requirements across entities within each CIIP sector
• Support for the development of the entity, sector , and national-level views of cyber 
security, to address potential IA risks that emerge from the interconnectivity of 
entities and sectors 
• Support the performance management and the evolution of the controls in these 
standards based on measuring and sharing effective performance indicators, as well 
as contributions from key stakeholders to support the ongoing development and 
refinement of these Standards
Compliance with these Standards will raise the level of national IA and help the 
UAE progress towards a more resilient national information and communication 
infrastructure, and cyberspace. All UAE government entities and other entities identified 
as critical1 by NESA are obligated to implement these Standards. However, NESA highly 
recommends all entities in the UAE to adopt these Standards on a voluntary basis, as 
applicable, in order to participate in raising the nation minimum-security levels.

--- Page 12 ---
13 
The purpose of the UAE IA Standards is to provide requirements to raise the 
minimum level of protection of information assets and supporting systems across all 
implementing entities in the UAE, as outlined in Section 2.1.
In particular, the UAE IA Standards provides:
•	 Description	 of	how	information	 assurance	 is	achieved	 at	the	national,	 sector,	
and	entity	levels
•	 Enable	a	risk-based	approach	for	the	implementation	of	these	Standards 	
•	 Outline	of	 the		roles	and	 responsibilities	 of	key	stakeholders	for	 the	planning,

19UAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 02  UAE IA Standards Overview
The UAE IA Standards provides management and technical information security 
controls (henceforth referred to as “security controls”) for entities to establish, 
implement, maintain, and continuously improve information assurance.
NESA will designate the critical entities, as per the UAE CIIP Policy, mandated to 
implement the UAE IA Standards and apply its requirements to the use, processing, 
storage, and transmission of information or data, and the systems and processes used 
for those purposes. This includes information in physical or electronic form that may be 
owned, leased, or otherwise in the possession, custody, or control of the entities. 2.1
SCOPE

--- Page 19 ---
20The UAE IA Standards are critical element of the National Cyber Security Strategy 
(NCSS). Given this, these Standards rely on related and complementary policies issued 
under the NCSS. Table 1 below describes the relationships and dependencies between 
the UAE IA Standards and some other NCSS policies:2.2

21UAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 02  UAE IA Standards Overview
The entity, sector, and national contexts refer to the integrated relationships and 
interactions among individual sector entities, sector regulators, and NESA to form 
sector and national level views on prevailing IA requirements, corresponding adequacy 
of IA capabilities, and on-going situational awareness.  
While IA Standards that exist today prescribe requirements for the entity level, they do 
not take into account the IA issues that emerge from the systemic interconnectivity 
of entities at the sector and national levels. This leads to two key shortcomings: first, 
continued exposure to security threats that no single entity is able to address individually 
(such as Advanced Persistent Threats), and second, an isolated approach to handling 
risks related to inter-sector dependencies, often leading to increased efforts, cost, and 
risk exposure of concerned sectors.
The UAE IA Standards includes minimum IA requirements and capabilities for UAE 
entities to integrate into the Sector and National Contexts (refer to Figure 2).2.3

222 In the case of sectors with no regulator, NESA is responsible for consolidating and analyzing the 
information shared by entities, and developing the sector view of risks either directly or by identifying 
an entity to act as the “Information Assurance Sector Regulator”The development of the sector and national contexts relies on the consolidation and 
analysis of key entity level information, in particular relating to the state of the UAE IA 
Standards implementation, risk assessment outcomes, as well as information relating to 
cyber security threats, risks and incidents. 2To enable the sector and national contexts, 
entities are required to submit UAE IA Standards implementation progress and key cyber 
security information to sector regulators, who consolidate and analyze the information 
to form a sector view of risks and assess the state of these Standards implementation. 
Similarly, sector regulators are required to submit the analyzed sector-level information 
to NESA, to form the national views on critical risks, situational awareness and state of 
these Standards implementation across sectors. 
Having formed the national view of risks and state of these Standards implementation, 
NESA shares relevant risk and UAE IA Standards implementation best practices with 
the sector regulators to enhance the effectiveness of these Standards implementation, 
as well as the cyber incident management and the cyber risk management programs. 
Similarly, sector regulators share key risk and implementation related information with 
relevant entities to progress the implementation of these Standards, and enhance the 
effectiveness of the incident management and risk management programs.
In summary, the UAE IA Standards is designed to avoid the isolation created by 
a single-entity approach to IA, hence creating a stronger and more integrated 
approach for national information assurance.UAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 02  UAE IA Standards Overview

--- Page 22 ---
23UAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 02  UAE IA Standards Overview
The UAE IA Standards promotes a lifecycle approach for establishing, implementing, 
maintaining and continuously improving information assurance. This lifecycle approach 
ensures continual improvement of the UAE’s information assurance capabilities based 
on well-defined activities:
A. UNDERSTANDING an entity’s and / or sector’s information security requirements 
and the need to establish a policy and objectives for information security
B.	 CONDUCTING  risk assessments, identifying appropriate risk treatment actions, 
and selecting controls to manage the risks
C.	 IMPLEMENTING  and operating security controls to manage information security 
risks in the context of the entity’s or sector’s overall business risks
D.	 MONITORING  and reviewing the performance and effectiveness of the information 
security processes and controls
E.	 ENSURING  continual improvement based on objective measurements
The continuous improvement aspect of the IA lifecycle ensures that IA capabilities are 
continuously adapted and evolved in line with changing requirements.   The application 
of the IA lifecycle is facilitated best when integrated in the planning and governance 
activities of an entity or sector.   2.4

OVERVIEW
The purpose of this chapter is to explain key concepts related to the implementation 
of the UAE IA Standards such as the risk-based approach to information assurance and 
the applicability and prioritization of security controls.  This chapter also highlights key 
stakeholder roles and responsibilities for the effective adoption and progression of the 
UAE IA Standards, and it lists critical implementation success factors.
The implementation of these Standards is meant to complement any existing 
information assurance programs at implementing entities.  This Standard represents 
the sole point of reference for compliance against its requirements, as measured by the 
criteria associated with each of its security controls.UAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 03  UAE IA Standards Implementation

283.2
RISK-BASED APPROACH
In today’s world, the cyber threat landscape is evolving rapidly at a pace where entities are 
challenged to keep up with the number and variety of threats.  In the face of this growing 
threat landscape, entities need to adopt practical measures to defend their critical 
information and information infrastructure against their most critical vulnerabilities that 
could be exploited by threats.  To this end, a risk-based approach provides entities with 
a pragmatic mean to identify their most critical vulnerabilities that could expose them to 
risks, and develop corresponding appropriate treatments.
Adopting a risk-based approach ensures that security controls are instituted in 
accordance with current risk assessments commensurate with the risk and magnitude 
of the impact that could result if critical information assets are compromised.  The 
risk-based approach briefly outlined in these Standards summarizes a systematic 
methodology for identifying, estimating, evaluating, and treating identified entity-level 
risks. It consists of eight key activities as illustrated in Figure 3.

29Performing a risk management is a key step towards the implementation of the UAE IA 
Standards as it helps entities identify, prioritize, and measure the effectiveness of the 
security controls that are needed to treat identified entity-specific risks. Critical entities 
implementing these Standards shall also refer to the National Cyber Risk Management 
Framework (NCRMF) which highlights the National Risk Management approach and 
process of Critical Information Infrastructure.
ACTIVITY 1: ESTABLISHING THE ENVIRONMENT
The risk assessment process should be initiated by establishing objectives, strategies, 
scope and parameters of the activities of the entity, or those parts of the entity where 
the risk management process is being applied. Further, criteria for assessing risks should 
be established in line with the entity’s objectives, available resources, and the magnitude 
of impact that could result from the compromise of confidentiality, integrity and/or 
availability of information assets. Topics such as authenticity and non-repudiation could 
also be considered based on the entity context.
ACTIVITY 2: RISK IDENTIFICATION
The entity should identify sources of risk, areas of impacts, events and their causes, 
and the potential consequences. The aim of this step is to generate a comprehensive 
list of risks based on the identified information security requirements. Because a risk 
that is not identified at this stage will not be included in further analysis, comprehensive 
identification is critical.
ACTIVITY 3: RISK ESTIMATION
Risk estimation involves consideration of the causes and sources of risk in the form 
of threats and vulnerabilities, their impacts in terms of consequences of a loss of 
confidentiality, integrity and/or availability of information, and the likelihood that the 
potential impacts will occur. The risk should also take into account the effectiveness 
and efficiency of existing controls in addressing the current level of risk.  
ACTIVITY 4:  RISK EVALUATION
Risk evaluation involves comparing the level of risk found during the risk estimation 
activity with risk criteria established at the beginning of the process as part of establishing 
the context (Activity 1). The objective is to determine which risks are outside acceptable 
parameters and therefore require treatment.UAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 03  UAE IA Standards Implementation

--- Page 29 ---
30ACTIVITY 5: RISK TREATMENT
For each of the risks identified in the risk assessment, a number of treatment options 
can be considered and applied either individually, or in combination, for treating the 
risk. There are several options that are usually considered for treating risks; these  
options include: 
• Risk Reduction  – Reducing the risk by applying security controls. The selection 
of security controls should follow a risk-based approach by apply the first set of 
security controls that treat the highest risks identified during the Risk Evaluation 
(See 3.4 Prioritization of Controls).
•	 Risk Retention  – Accepting the risk based on the entity’s risk accepting criteria.  
•	 Risk Avoidance  – Avoiding the activity or condition causing the risk.   
•	 Risk Transfer – Transferring the risk to another party.  
ACTIVITY 6: RISK ACCEPTANCE
The risk acceptance is the decision to accept residual risk by the management of the 
entity. The management based on the acceptance criteria should review and approve 
the treat plan and the residual risk.   
ACTIVITY 7:  RISK MONITORING AND REVIEW
The results of the risk assessment and treatment process need to be monitored 
and reviewed for ongoing risk management, and to ensure their continued suitability.  
The monitoring and review of information security risks should be a planned part of 
the risk management process, and involve regular checking or surveillance as well as 
improvements when significant changes occur. The entity’s monitoring and review 
processes should encompass all aspects of the risk management process, including 
the risk criteria, the identified assets, threats, risks, risk treatment options and  
security controls.
ACTIVITY 8: RISK COMMUNICATION AND CONSULTATION
Communication and consultation with key stakeholders should take place during all 
stages of the risk management process. Therefore, plans for communication and 
consultation should be developed at an early stage. These should address issues 
relating to the risk itself, its causes, its consequences (if known), and the measures 
being taken to treat it. Effective external and internal communication and consultation 
should take place to ensure that stakeholders and those accountable for implementing 
the risk management process understand the basis on which decisions are made, as 
well as the reasons why particular actions are required. UAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 03  UAE IA Standards Implementation

--- Page 30 ---
313.3
APPLICABILITY OF CONTROLS
The concept of Applicability relates to the identification of security controls for treating 
entity-specific risks as outlined in [Step 5] of the risk assessment process described 
above (section 3.2). 
The security controls included in these Standards are developed to treat a typical 
entity risk profile developed based on benchmark risk registers. While this common risk 
profile is widely applicable to implementing entities, NESA recognizes that entity risk 
profiles do differ based on their specific business and operational context.  Given these 
differences, not all security controls provided in these Standards might be applicable to 
all entities.  Therefore, these Standards require that the identification of the security 
controls be based on an entity risk assessment resulting in applicable security controls 
for the treatment of identified risks. 
Prior to performing the risk assessment process, an entity should consider all security 
controls to be applicable. However, an individual entity may exclude some security 
controls on the basis of the risk assessment outcomes, provided that adequate 
justification is submitted to NESA. 
Moreover, certain security controls included in these Standards represent requirements 
for instituting foundational IA capabilities within an entity, and as such, are considered 
“Always Applicable”. Given their foundational role, the “Always Applicable” security 
controls shall be implemented by each relevant entity regardless of its risk assessment 
outcomes (refer to Annex 1 for a summary of “Always Applicable” controls).
In	summary,	 the	concept	 of	Applicability	 identifies	 the	security	 controls	 that	
are	mandatory	 for	implementation	 based	on	the	list	of	applicable	 controls 	
resulting	 from	the	entity	risk	assessment	 process,	 above	and	beyond	the	
“Always	 Applicable”	 controls.		 In	the	absence	 of	an	entity	risk	assessment,	 all	
the	security	 controls	 detailed	 in	these	Standards	 are	deemed	 applicable	 and	
therefore	mandatory	for	implementation. 	UAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 03  UAE IA Standards Implementation

--- Page 31 ---
321.2.3.3.4
PRIORITIZATION OF CONTROLS
The concept of Prioritization relates to grouping the UAE IA Standards security controls 
in order of importance for realizing a minimum level of information assurance protection, 
and for enabling a phased and incremental implementation of these Standards. 
The prioritization approach of the UAE IA Standards is based on the relative impact of 
security controls in helping implementing entities to: 
• Mitigate common threats 
• Build foundational IA capabilities
Based on these criteria, the security controls are grouped into four priority levels – P1, 
P2, P3, and P4 in this order of importance – and the outcome of the prioritization is 
included in Annex 2. 
While all the applicable security controls across the four priority levels are mandatory for 
critical entities implementing these Standards, they are required to begin implementing 
these Standards with P1 security controls given their highest relative impact in protecting 
against critical threats and building foundational information assurance capabilities.
Critical entities implementing these Standards may alter (promote or demote) the 
suggested priority of controls based on the outcomes of their risk assessment, with the 
exception of top priority controls (P1), which if applicable, may be augmented but never 
reduced (refer to Figure 4). UAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 03  UAE IA Standards Implementation

COMPLIANCE WITH THE UAE IA STANDARDS
The purpose of this chapter is to provide a definition of compliance with respect to the 
requirements of these Standards and to outline the measurement criteria and approach 
that NESA will follow when evaluating compliance.
Within the context of this Standard, compliance refers to the comparison between the 
requirements outlined in this Standard and the actual state of implementation of these 
requirements within an entity. This can be measured on an individual control basis, as well 
as the degree of compliance of an entity overall with the complete set of requirements.  
Increasing the level of compliance with the security controls provided in this Standard is 
the key to ensuring immediate and long lasting improvements of information assurance 
within the UAE and the overall success of the UAE’s Information Assurance program. UAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 04  Compliance with the UAE IA Standards

--- Page 41 ---
42To this end, NESA will ensure that an effective compliance monitoring scheme is 
in place which provides NESA with the visibility of the current status of compliance 
with this Standard and the activities needed for improving the overall security of the 
UAE’s cyberspace.  The compliance monitoring scheme is outlined in the UAE NIAF 
Governance and is based on the following four elements:
CONTROLS
All security controls specified in the UAE IA Standards need to be considered by each 
entity, and any entity wishing to claim compliance with these Standards shall implement 
these controls based on the following requirements:
• Controls that are “Always Applicable” – these security controls are essential and 
shall be implemented by any entity wishing to claim compliance with the UAE IA 
Standards. Omission of any of these controls is not acceptable and constitutes  
non-conformity.
• Controls that are applicable based on the risk assessment – the entity shall 
determine which of the security controls provided in the UAE IA Standards are 
applicable in its particular situation based on the results of the risk assessment.  Any 
exclusion of these controls needs to be justified and evidence needs to be provided 
such that the associated risks have been accepted by accountable persons or  
authorizing entities.    
The overall set of security controls that are “Always Applicable” and those security 
controls that have been determined as being applicable based on the risk assessment 
are “mandatory” for the entity to implement, and will be the basis of the compliance 
monitoring scheme.
SUB-CONTROLS
For each of the security controls, a set of sub-controls are specified. These sub-controls 
specify mandatory implementation requirements. Also, it is expected that each entity 
claiming compliance shall implement the selected security controls by complying with 
the sub-controls during the implementation process as described below.    
The entity shall implement all of the sub-controls of the “Always Applicable” security 
controls.  Omission of any of these sub-controls is not acceptable and constitutes non-
conformity to the UAE IA Standards.
The entity can decide to not implement a sub-control of a security control identified 
by the risk assessment, if this action is appropriately justified (e.g. following the risk 
assessment or due to decisions or circumstances in the entity), or to implement the 
sub-controls in a different way.  Any deviation from the sub-controls needs to be 
justified and evidence needs to be provided such that the associated risks have been 
accepted by accountable persons or authorizing entities.UAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 04  Compliance with the UAE IA Standards

--- Page 42 ---
43UAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 04  Compliance with the UAE IA Standards
PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
Performance indicators are intended to provide entities implementing the UAE IA 
Standards with some basic guidelines to measure the quality and effectiveness of 
its compliance with the control sub-families and controls of this Standard. Entities 
implementing this Standard can deviate from these performance indicators, but are 
required to provide a reason for this deviation and to specify the new performance 
indicators when doing so.
For compliance with this Standard, entities need to use performance indicators to 
measure the quality and effectiveness of the implemented security controls.
AUTOMATION,	THREAT/VULNERABILITY 	
DESCRIPTION	 FOR	SUB-FAMILIES	 OF	CONTROLS,	 AND	
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE FOR CONTROLS
The information on possible automation and the implementation guidance for security 
controls are provided for information purposes only and can be implemented as the 
entity prefers, without any further explanation or justification. Descriptions of typical 
threats and vulnerabilities are also provided for information purposes. 
In summary, NESA places a high level of importance on understanding and improving 
the level of compliance with this Standard as one of the core elements of increasing 
the level of success of the UAE’s information assurance program.  At the same time, 
NESA understands that individual entities face specific circumstances that require a 
certain level of flexibility to manage properly.  As such, this Standard aims to strike an 
appropriate balance of mandatory requirements versus suggested security controls. 
This is based on the risk-based approach that each entity shall develop internally in order 
to make appropriate and justified decisions. Moreover, all implementing entities are 
welcomed and encouraged to share their experience in regard to the implementation 
of the security controls.

2) The requirements of these interested parties 
3) Factors related to its sector or national context
4) Its internal capabilities
5) Its organizational structure
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
Before starting the design and implementation of information security within an entity, it is 
important to evaluate and understand both the external and internal context of this entity, since 
these can significantly influence the design of information security solutions.  For the external 
factors, this activity should include topics such as:
A. The industry sector, legal, regulatory, financial, technological, economic, political, natural  
         and competitive environment, whether international, national, regional or local
B. Key drivers and trends having impact on the information security objectives of the entity
C. Relationships with, and dependencies of, external stakeholders
The evaluation of internal factors should address topics such as:
A. Governance, organizational structure, roles and accountabilities
B. Capabilities, understood in terms of resources and knowledge (e.g. capital, time, people,  
         processes, systems and technologies)
C. Information systems, information flows and decision making processes
D. Relationships with, and perceptions of, internal stakeholders
E. The form and extent of contractual relationships

commitment to information security.  
SUB-CONTROLTop management commitment shall:
1) Ensure the information security policy and the information security 
objectives are established and are compatible with the strategic 
direction of the entity
2) Ensure the integration of the information security requirements into 
the entity’s processes
3) Ensure that the resources needed for information security  
are available
4) Communicate the importance of the effectiveness of information 
security management
5) Direct and support persons to contribute to the effectiveness of 
information security and conforming to the requirements of  
these  Standards
6) Promote continual improvement
7) Support other relevant management roles to demonstrate their 
leadership as it applies to their areas of responsibility
8) Give direction to and participating in reviews of information security, 
including risks, controls and effectiveness, on a high level
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
Top management commitment and its visible demonstration is one important contributor 
to the overall success of information security within an entity.  This does not mean that top 
management is carrying out the actions listed above themselves, but they need to ensure that 
the actions do take place, and that they are concluded successfully.
One important part in these responsibilities is the assignment of appropriate resources, 
without which information security cannot succeed (see also M1.4.1 below).  Another important 
aspect is the connection between business goals and requirements and information security. 
Ideally, this is a balance between these items, and it should never be the case that information 
security hinders the business.  It should, of course, also not be the case that an entity takes any 
unjustified risks and neglects security.  The final decision what takes preference has to be taken 
by top management. 
Management should identify the needs for internal or external specialist information security 
advice, and review and coordinate results of the advice throughout the entity.

responsibility for the establishment, implementation, maintenance 
and continual improvement of information security
4) An Information Security Committee is established that oversees 
and governs the establishment, implementation, maintenance and 
continual improvement of information security in the entity, and that 
integrates information security in the entity
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
The roles of the “Information Security Manager” and the “Information Security Committee” are 
important contributors to successful information security, and have therefore been defined as 
sub-controls.  When implementing these sub-controls, please keep in mind that it is important 
to address these roles, but the name and way of implementation of these roles can be chosen 
by the entity.
The Information Security Committee should have a leading role for information security in the 
entity and should be responsible for handling the important information security issues. The 
members of the Information Security Committee should have a sufficient understanding of 
information security for directing, monitoring, and completing the necessary tasks. Typical 
tasks of an Information Security Committee could be:
A. Defining and establishing roles and responsibilities for information security
B. Monitor the adequacy of resources to maintain and improve information security in the  
            entity and recommend to management the acquiring of additional resources where necessary
C. Providing input into the development, approval and implementation of information security  
         policies and procedures

J. Reviewing audit reports and initiating appropriate corrective actions
The Information Security Manager should be the focal point for information security within 
the entity and should be responsible to direct the information security team (if present) and to 
provide valuable input into the Information Security Committee.
Additional responsibilities, such as technical security managers or asset owners can also be 
identified, as needed to implement information security in the entity. If necessary, roles and 
responsibilities should also be defined from contractors and third party users, and it should be 
ensured that all roles and responsibilities are reviewed periodically and kept up to date.
It is of particular importance that all people are aware of their responsibilities for information 
security and that everybody is aware of their duty to report information security incidents  
and events..

CONTROLThe entity shall identify and properly manage the risks related to its 
information and information systems from business processes involving 
external parties  
SUB-CONTROLThe entity shall:
1) Identify risks to its information and information systems and 
implement the appropriate controls before granting access to any 
external party
2) Define an external party access policy
3) Identify and adopt proper controls to limit physical and logical access 
to information assets and entity information systems
4) Monitor external party access to entity information and entity 
information systems
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
Where there is a need to allow an external party access to the information systems or 
information of an entity, a risk assessment should be carried out to identify any requirements 
for specific controls. The identification of risks related to external party access should take into 
account the following issues:
A. The information systems an external party is required to access
B. The type of access the external party will have to the information and information systems, e.g.
1- Physical access, e.g. to offices, computer rooms, filing cabinets
2- Logical access, e.g. to an entity’s databases, information systems
3- Network connectivity between the entity’s and the external party’s network(s), e.g. 
permanent connection, remote access
4- Whether the access is taking place on-site or off-site
C. The value and sensitivity of the information involved, and its criticality for business operations
D. The controls necessary to protect information that is not intended to be accessible by 
external parties
E. The external party personnel involved in handling the entity’s information
F. How the entity or personnel authorized to have access can be identified, the authorization 
verified, and how often this needs to be reconfirmed
G. The different means and controls employed by the external party when storing, 
processing, communicating, sharing and exchanging information
H. The impact of access not being available to the external party when required, and the 
external party entering or receiving inaccurate or misleading information

damages, and the terms and conditions for the continuation of external party access in the 
case of an information security incident
J. Legal and regulatory requirements and other contractual obligations relevant to the 
external party that should be taken into account
K. How the interests of any other stakeholders may be affected by the arrangements
Access by external parties to the entity’s information should not be provided until the appropriate 
controls have been implemented and, where feasible, a contract has been signed defining the 
terms and conditions for the connection or access and the working arrangement. Generally, all 
security requirements resulting from work with external parties or internal controls should be 
reflected by the agreement with the external party. It should be ensured that the external party 
is aware of their obligations, and accepts the responsibilities and liabilities involved in accessing, 
processing, communicating, or managing the entity’s information and information systems.UAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 05  Security Controls

The entity shall document the compliance with the “mandatory” controls 
in a way that allows unique reference to the requirements of this Standard. 
(Sample Compliance Template may be provided by NESA in this regard).  
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
One of the most important aspects of implementing document management in an entity is 
to do this consistent and throughout the entity, with supporting training, awareness and also 
checking that the document management controls are followed. It is necessary to include 
templates for document management in all documentation, irrespective of the form it takes. 
All this can be supported by using document management systems and other controls to 
technically ensure that the necessary actions are carried out, wherever it is possible, it is 
recommended to use technical support to achieve a complete implementation.
Compliance with this control should be checked every so often, and non-compliances should 
be reacted to, to demonstrate that this actually is an important control everybody needs to  
comply with.
Particular attention should be given to the protection of records – it is not so important for 
records to have an author (they are often system based- and a change history (they should not 
change at all if they are supposed to provide evidence), but the date of issue and the integrity of 
the record are important items to maintain.UAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 05  Security Controls

assessments; therefore, this implementation guidance will just provide an overview of the most 
important concepts. Entities should take into account relevant NESA’s issuances and guidance 
with regard to risk management when performing risk assessment.  
LEVEL OF DETAIL OF THE INFORMATION SECURITY RISK ASSESSMENT
Some entities might find it difficult or time consuming to conduct a detailed risk assessment. The 
choice of a suitable risk management approach should be taken when drafting the Information 
Security Risk Management Policy (refer to M2.1.1), and the implementation guidance there 
explains the considerations the entity should take into account when deciding on a suitable way 
of doing information security risk management.  The entity should document these results and 
should be able to provide reasons for the decision taken.
An entity will only be considered as being compliant with the requirements of this Standard if 
they apply a suitable information security risk management policy. UAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 05  Security Controls

--- Page 71 ---
72ASSET IDENTIFICATION 
The assets to be considered in the information security risk assessment are all information 
assets, i.e. include:
A. INFORMATION : Databases, files, contracts and agreements, system documentation, 
research information, user manuals, training material, operational or support procedures, etc.
B. SOFTWARE ASSETS:  Application software, system software, development tools, and utilities
C. PHYSICAL ASSETS:  Computer equipment, communications equipment, removable media
D. OTHER EQUIPMENT
E. SERVICES: Computing and communications services, general utilities, e.g. heating, lighting, 
power, and air-conditioning
F. PEOPLE , and their qualifications, skills, and experience
G. INTANGIBLES , such as reputation and image of the entity
The identified assets are summarized in the Asset Inventory (refer to T1.2.1).
It might be useful to summarize assets in suitable groups (e.g. all PCs in a call center, processing 
the same type of information), but care should be taken to only group “like with like” when doing 
so.   It is also helpful to take account of business processes, as they often can help to understand 
the information flow and how assets are working in the entity.
IDENTIFICATION OF THREATS
Threats are not very dependent on the entity and its business; they are just out there trying to 
succeed.  When identifying threats, it can be helpful to use threat lists (e.g. those provided in 
this Standard, or in other standards, such as ISO/IEC 27005), and to look into incident reports 
(incidents are always related to threats that have been successful- and audit reports, and to 
keep an open mind to the latest development as new threats will continue to emerge. It is also 
important to not only look at threats from the outside, such as hackers or malware, but also 
consider inside threats.  A disgruntled employee with given access rights can often do more 
damage as outsiders.
IDENTIFICATION OF VULNERABILITIES 
The identification of vulnerabilities should be based on an assessment of the existing controls.  
To do so, it is recommended to conduct a gap analysis, which checks the controls in place 
against this Standard. The results of the gap analysis form an input in the identification of 
vulnerabilities as well as into the assessment of the risk likelihood (see also M2.2.2 below). Any 
control, which has been identified as missing, not completely in place, not fully documented or 
not complied with identifies at least one (if not more- vulnerabilities, which might be exploited 
by the identified threats.
PLEASE	 NOTE:	The	identification	 of	threats	and	vulnerabilities	 takes	place	per	each	identified	 asset,	
so	this	easily	produces	 a	lot	of	information.	 To	keep	the	amount	 of	information	 manageable,	 it	is	
recommended	to:
A.	 Identify	threats	and	vulnerabilities	with	the	existing	controls	in	mind 	
B.	 Identify	only	threat/vulnerability	pairs	where	the	threat	will	actually	exploit	the	vulnerability

3) Determine the levels of risk
4) Document the results of the risk analysis
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
There is a lot of information related to the performance of information security risk assessments, 
and more details will be provided in a separate risk management document, therefore, this 
implementation guidance will just provide an overview of the most important concepts.
Consequences of losses of confidentiality, integrity or availability: The first part of assessing 
the consequences of losses of confidentiality, integrity or availability is to identify the business 
importance the information asset under consideration has.  Damage to an asset that is 
important for the business is much likelier to cause severe consequences than an asset that is 
not as important. Based on the business use of the asset, the consequences for a loss of the 
following needs to be assessed:
A. CONFIDENTIALITY –  This means the information asset is only accessible to those 
authorized to access it
B. INTEGRITY – This means the information asset has not been modified in any  
unauthorized way
C. AVAILABILITY –  This means the information asset is available, when needed
To make the results of this assessment comparable, scales should be used, which should have 
been defined in the Information Security Risk Management Policy (see M2.1.1 above).
The assessment of these consequences should be done together with the business users of 
the information assets, as these can give important input into the process because they are 
aware of the security requirements for their assets. This can be done by interviews and/or 
questionnaires, but it is important to ensure that the business users understand what is asked 
from them.
As a result, each asset should have identified consequences of losses of confidentiality, integrity 
and availability..UAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 05  Security Controls

--- Page 73 ---
74LIKELIHOOD	OF	THREAT/VULNERABILITY	COMBINATIONS
The input into the assessment of the likelihood that a particular threat exploits a vulnerability is 
based on very similar considerations as the identification of threats and vulnerabilities (see M2.2.1 
above).  The likelihood of a threat occurring can be derived from threat catalogues and statistics, 
as well as incident records, audit logs and reports, etc. the entity has produced.
The level of vulnerability is based on how good or bad the controls are that have been put in place, 
so this can also be derived from the results of the gap analysis (see M2.2.1 above).  Finally, the 
likelihood of the threat to occur and the level of vulnerability are put together to determine the 
likelihood that this particular threat/vulnerability combination occurs.  How exactly these values 
are put together has been defined in the Information Security Risk Management Policy (see 
M2.1.1. above).
Determining the levels of risk: Based on the method to calculate risks, which has been chosen by 
the entity and has been documented in the Information Security Risk Management Policy (see 
M2.1.1. above), the risks should now be calculated using the consequences and likelihoods that 
have been assessed.

ANAL YSISPRIORITY P1
APPLICABILITY ALWAYS APPLICABLE
CONTROL The entity shall evaluate its information security risks.
SUB-CONTROLThe entity shall:
1) Compare the analyzed risks with the risk criteria established in the 
information security risk management policy (See M2.1.1)
2) Establish priorities for treatment of the identified risks
3) Document the results of the risk evaluation and share with national 
and sector authorities, as required
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
There is a lot of information related to the performance of information security risk assessments, 
and more details will be provided in a separate risk management document, therefore, this 
implementation guidance will just provide an overview of the most important concepts.
Once the risks have been calculated (see M2.2.2 above), the entity should compare the risk levels 
assessed with the risk criteria that have been established documented in the Information Security 
Risk Management Policy (see M2.1.1. above). This will rank the risks in order of severity and will 
identify those that are acceptable (because they are below the general threshold of acceptance), 
and those risks that will require treatment.
If necessary, the entity can assign additional priorities to the risks, e.g. if a risk – despite of not being 
high- relates to a very vital business process.  Any such assignment is entirely up to the entity, any 
decisions made should be reasoned and documented. 
Decisions on risks should take account of the wider context of the risk and include consideration 
of the requirements of other parties, such as sector, regional or national initiatives. In some 
circumstances, the risk evaluation can lead to a decision to undertake further analysis.UAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 05  Security Controls

OPTIONSPRIORITY P1
APPLICABILITY ALWAYS APPLICABLE
CONTROLThe entity shall select appropriate information security risk treatment 
options, taking account of the risk assessment results.
SUB-CONTROL1) The entity shall consider the following risk treatment options and 
select one or more of them for each of the risks that have  
been assessed:
• Risk Reduction – Reducing the risk by applying security controls
• Risk Retention – Accepting the risk based on the entity’s risk     
         accepting criteria established on the information management    
         risk policy (See M2.1.1)
• Risk Avoidance – Avoiding the activity or condition causing the risk  
• Risk Transfer – Transferring the risk to another party
2) The entity shall assess the risk treatment chosen to ensure that the 
selection of risk treatment options is successful by:
• Deciding whether residual risk levels are tolerable
• If not tolerable, generating a new risk treatment
• Assessing the effectiveness of that treatment (see also M2.3)
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
Selecting the most appropriate information security risk treatment option involves balancing 
the costs and efforts of implementation against the benefits derived, with regard to sector, 
national or regulatory requirements. Decisions should also take into account risks which can 
warrant risk treatment that is not justifiable on economic grounds, e.g. severe (high negative 
consequence- but rare (low likelihood- risks.
A number of treatment options can and should be considered and applied either individually 
or in combination. When selecting risk treatment options, the entity should consider the 
expectations of the sector and national level.  Though equally effective, some risk treatments 
can be more acceptable to some stakeholders than to others.
The selected risk treatment options should be documented in the risk treatment plan. The 
treatment plan should clearly identify the priority order in which individual risk treatments should 
be implemented.
Risk treatment itself can introduce risks. A significant risk can be the failure or ineffectiveness of 
the risk treatment measures. Monitoring needs to be an integral part of the risk treatment plan 
to give assurance that the measures remain effective (see also M6).UAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 05  Security Controls

78M2.3.2IDENTIFICA TION 
OF CONTROLSPRIORITY P1
APPLICABILITY ALWAYS APPLICABLE
CONTROLThe entity shall identify all controls that are necessary to implement the 
information security risk treatment option(s) chosen.
SUB-CONTROLThe entity shall:
1) Consider the controls included in these Standards as a starting point 
for the control identification
2) Ensure that no controls are overlooked by producing the Statement 
of Applicability (refer to M2.3.4)
3) Identify controls in addition to the controls suggested in this 
Standard that are specific to the entity
4) Take account of the criteria for accepting risks (refer to M2.3.1) as 
well as legal, regulatory and contractual requirements when making 
the control selection.
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
Controls should be identified to manage the risks, based on the identified risk treatment 
option(s).  It is important to specify the relation between the risks and the identified controls, 
this relation is important for the ongoing risk management and should be documented in the 
risk treatment plan.  
The first basis of control identification should be this Standard, which suggests a set of “risk-
based applicable” controls that addresses a lot of the common information security risks. 
Sector-specific controls should be identified to support the specific needs of the entity within 
its sector.
The entity should also identify controls that are required for risk management and not 
documented in this Standard.  It is likely that such controls exist as an entity has risks specific to 
its business and its way to operate, and the identification of additional controls completes the 
controls for information security risk management.
The entity should compile a list of controls which have been identified to produce a Statement 
of Applicability (refer to M2.3.4). It might be that the Statement of Applicability (refer to 
Implementation Guidance of M2.3.4) leads to a revision of the identified controls.  This is the 
intention of producing the Statement of Applicability, it is supposed to act as a safety net that 
ensures that no impotent control has been overlooked.
It is important to be aware of that the list of identified controls is very likely to contain sensitive 
information. Therefore, appropriate care should be taken when making the summary of controls 
available to both internal and external recipients.UAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 05  Security Controls

B. Resources required
C. Responsibilities and priorities for managing information security risks 
D. Target dates for implementation of the identified controls
2) The entity shall document the risk treatment plan.
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
The purpose of risk treatment plans is to document how the chosen risk treatment options will 
be implemented. The information provided in treatment plans should include:
A. The reasons for selection of treatment options
B. The controls that have been identified to implement the selected risk treatment option(s)
C. The identified risk reduction or other modification that is intended to be achieved by the 
identified control(s), also called residual risk
D. Those who are accountable for approving the plan
E. Those responsible for implementing controls and the overall plan
F. Proposed actions to achieve this implementation
G. Priorities of implementation

I. Target dates for control implementation
J. Interdependencies of control implementation (when the implementation of a control 
requires the complete implementation of another control)
K. Performance measures and constraints (which can also be documented elsewhere); and
L. Reporting and monitoring requirements
The risk treatment plan should be integrated with the management processes of the entity 
and discussed with appropriate stakeholders.
Management should be aware of the nature and extent of the residual risk after risk treatment 
and should accept the residual risks. The residual risk should be documented and subjected to 
monitoring, review and, where appropriate, further treatment.UAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 05  Security Controls

CONTROLThe entity shall compare the controls identified in M2.3.2 above with 
the “risk-based applicable” controls contained in this Standard and shall 
verify that no necessary controls have been omitted.
SUB-CONTROLThe entity shall produce and document a Statement of Applicability  
that contains:
1) The controls that have been identified as necessary
2) Reasons for identification of these controls
3) Their current status of implementation
4) Justification for exclusion of any of the “risk-based applicable” 
controls contained in these  Standards
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
The Statement of Applicability should be produced to ensure that no control from these 
Standards that is required by the entity for risk treatment is overlooked.  
If the first version of the Statement of Applicability identifies controls from this Standard whose 
exclusion cannot be justified, the entity should go back to the control identification process 
(refer to M2.3.2) and check whether there are risks whose treatment could benefit from 
this control.  If this is the case, the control under consideration should be included in the risk 
treatment.  If this is not the case, the entity should go back to the risk identification and ensure 
that all important risks have been identified. 
The reasons for the identification of controls is needed to form the link between risks and 
controls – this relationship can also be documented in the risk treatment plan (refer to M2.3.3).  
The Statement of Applicability can be a separate document, or can be combined with the risk 
treatment plan, this can be decided by the entity.UAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 05  Security Controls

A. Be consistent with the information security policy
B. Be measurable (if practicable)
C. Take into account applicable information security requirements, 
and risk assessment and treatment results
D. Be communicated within the entity
E. Be updated as appropriate
F. Be documented
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
Based on the business objectives for information security and the results of the information 
security risk assessment and risk treatment process, information security objectives should be 
identified. The entity can consider high level objectives, such as:
A. Maintaining the confidentially of sensitive entity information
B. Successful management of the information security risks
C. Efficient management of information security in the entity
D. Compliance with sector or national requirements
These high level information security objectives are often directly derived from the business 
objectives, and other, lower level objectives, can be identified to support their fulfillment. 
The lower level information security objectives can be identified based on the results of the 
information security risk assessment and risk treatment process, and can also be identified by 
considering the following questions:
A. What third party relationships and agreements exist, and what are associated information 
security requirements?
B. Are there any services that have been outsourced?
C. What kind of protection is needed, and against what threats?
D. What are the distinct categories of information that require protection?
E. What are the distinct types of information activities that need to be protected?
F. What are the minimum market requirements for information security?
G. What additional information security controls should provide a competitive advantage for 
the entity?
H. What are the critical business processes, and how long can the entity tolerate interruptions 
to each critical business process?
When planning how to achieve the information security objectives, it can be helpful to 
develop an equivalent of the risk treatment plan, i.e. a plan that details the actions, resources, 
responsibilities, time frames and methods of evaluating whether the objectives have  
been achieved.
When planning how to achieve its information security objectives, the entity shall determine:
A. What will be done
B. What resources will be required
C. Who will be responsible
D. When it will be completed
E. How the results will be evaluatedUAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 05  Security Controls

83IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
Monitoring and review should be a planned part of the information security risk management 
process and involve regular checking, surveillance and updates.  The monitoring should be an 
ongoing process, which identifies any changes that are relevant to information security risk 
management, and there should also be planned processes that ensure that risk assessment 
and treatment updates are taking place.  
Responsibilities for monitoring and review should be clearly defined. (Refer to NCRMF for 
further details)
The entity’s monitoring and review processes should encompass all aspects of the information 
security risk management process for the purposes of:
A. Ensuring that controls are effective in the risk management they are achieving
B. Integrating new information to improve the risk assessment and/or treatment
C. Analyzing and learning lessons from events (including near-misses), changes, trends, 
successes and failures;
D. Detecting changes in the external and internal context, including changes to risk criteria and 
the risk itself, which can require revision of risk treatments and priorities
E. Vulnerability Assessment should be conducted frequently even after implementing security 
controls to identify emerging risks, new threats, trends, etc. 
Progress in implementing risk treatment plans provides a performance indicator in itself. The 
results can be incorporated into the entity’s overall performance management, measurement 
and external and internal reporting activities.
The results of monitoring and review should be recorded and externally and internally reported 
as appropriate, and should also be used as an input to the review of the information security risk 
management policy (refer to M2.1.1).UAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 05  Security Controls

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
Communication and consultation with key stakeholders should take place during all stages of 
the risk management process. Therefore, plans for communication and consultation should be 
developed at an early stage. These should address issues relating to the risk itself, its causes, 
its consequences (if known), and the measures being taken to treat it. Effective external and 
internal communication and consultation should take place to ensure that stakeholders and 
those accountable for implementing the risk management process understand the basis on 
which decisions are made, as well as the reasons why particular actions are required. UAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 05  Security Controls

The entity should develop a program that ensures continued adequate awareness and 
competence for all persons doing work under the control of the entity.  This does include not 
only entity personnel but also any outsiders with access to information. Please note that the 
implementation of the awareness and training program might not be carried out by the entity 
and can, for example, be ensured contractually.
The first step in the program is the evaluation of the competencies required for the job function.  
The Information Security Manager, for example, should have a good understanding of the 
controls contained in this standard, and should know how to implement them and to maintain 
them effectively.
The entity should ensure that trainings take place as planned, and are not pushed off, e.g. due to 
work overload.  If such problems recur, it might be a sign for inadequate resourcing.  If trainings 
continue not to take place in the time frame planned, it is a non-conformity to sub-control 2- 
mentioned above.
The awareness and training program should ensure that records of all trainings are generated. 
These records should regularly be reviewed to ensure that all personnel have received the 
training that they require.
Whatever training is conducted, it is important that the effectiveness of this training is assessed.  
An easy way of such as assessment is to select trainings that include an exam at the end. 
Whenever this is not possible, interviews of feedback form should be used that provide enough

information or highly confidential information, the entity should also consider further, more 
detailed checks.
Procedures should define criteria and limitations for verification checks, e.g. who is eligible to 
screen people, and how, when and why verification checks are carried out.
A screening process should also be carried out for contractors, and third party users. Where 
contractors are provided through an agency the contract with the agency should clearly specify 
the agency’s responsibilities for screening and the notification procedures they need to follow if 
screening has not been completed or if the results give cause for doubt or concern. In the same 
way, the agreement with the third party should clearly specify all responsibilities and notification 
procedures for screening.
Information on all candidates being considered for positions within the entity should be collected 
and handled in accordance with any appropriate legislation existing in the relevant jurisdiction.

applicable characteristics
2) Determine specific system requirements resulting from the 
identified requirements
3) Define specific controls to ensure all record protection 
requirements are met
4) Periodically review requirements and associated controls for 
completeness
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)  
Records should be categorized into record types, e.g. accounting records, database records, 
transaction logs, audit logs, and operational procedures, each with details of retention periods 
and type of storage media. Any related cryptographic keying material and programs associated 
with encrypted archives or digital signatures, should also be stored to enable decryption of the 
records for the length of time the records are retained.
Consideration should be given to the possibility of deterioration of media used for storage 
of records. Storage and handling procedures should be implemented in accordance with 
manufacturer’s recommendations. For long term storage, the use of paper and microfiche 
should be considered. Where electronic storage media are chosen, procedures to ensure 
the ability to access data (both media and format readability) throughout the retention period 
should be included, to safeguard against loss due to future technology change.
Data storage systems should be chosen such that required data can be retrieved in an 
acceptable timeframe and format, depending on the requirements to be fulfilled.
The system of storage and handling should ensure clear identification of records and of their 
retention period as defined by national or regional legislation or regulations, if applicable. This 
system should permit appropriate destruction of records after that period if they are not 
needed by the entity.
To meet these record safeguarding objectives, the following steps should be taken within  
an entity:
A. Guidelines should be issued on the retention, storage, handling, and disposal of records  
and information
B. A retention schedule should be drawn up identifying records and the period of time for 
which they should be retained
C. An inventory of sources of key information should be maintained
D. Appropriate controls should be implemented to protect records and information from loss, 
destruction, and falsificationUAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 05  Security Controls

An organizational data protection and privacy policy should be developed and implemented. 
This policy should be communicated to all persons involved in the processing of  
personal information.
Compliance with this policy and all relevant data protection legislation and regulations 
requires appropriate management structure and control. Often this is best achieved by the 
appointment of a person responsible, such as a data protection officer, who should provide 
guidance to managers, users, and service providers on their individual responsibilities and the 
specific procedures that should be followed. Responsibility for handling personal information 
and ensuring awareness of the data protection principles should be dealt with in accordance 
with relevant legislation and regulations. Appropriate technical and organizational measures to

should be regarded as improper use of the information systems. If any unauthorized activity is 
identified by monitoring or other means, this activity should be brought to the attention of the 
individual manager concerned for consideration of appropriate disciplinary and/or legal action.
Legal advice should be taken before implementing monitoring procedures. All users should be 
aware of the precise scope of their permitted access and of the monitoring in place to detect 
unauthorized use. This can be achieved by giving users written authorization, a copy of which 
should be signed by the user and securely retained by the entity. Employees of an entity, 
contractors, and third party users should be advised that no access will be permitted except 
that which is authorized.
At log-on, a warning message should be presented to indicate that the information systems 
being entered are owned by the entity and that unauthorized access is not permitted. The user 
has to acknowledge and react appropriately to the message on the screen to continue with the

information security objectives, risk management, etc.
4) How to integrate incident reports in the overall picture of 
performance monitoring
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)  
Ongoing performance monitoring and evaluation is one of the major contributors to overall 
effective and success information security operation within any entity.  Therefore, the entity 
should have an overall framework for its monitoring and performance measurement activities.  
These activities can have several sources of input:
A. High level performance evaluation activities, such as the performance indictors suggested 
for sub-families in this Standard
B. Detailed performance evaluation activities, such as the performance indictors suggested 
for “risk-based applicable” controls
C. Ongoing monitoring, which detects deviations and necessary corrections
D. Incident reports, which indicate that one or more of the controls are not working as intended
The performance evaluation policy should define how these different performance indicators 
are integrated within the entity to provide an overall picture of information security performance 
to management, and how the results of these performance measurement activities can be 
presented to management for decision-making.UAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 05  Security Controls

2) Document the monitoring and measurement methods and results.
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)  
The continual improvement the entity needs to apply to its information security controls (see 
also M6.3.2) needs to make use of the monitoring and performance measurement results to 
identify which areas do require improvement. Therefore, these activities are key to keeping 
information security up to date, and fit for purpose of the entity’s requirements.
The results of monitoring and review should be recorded and externally and internally reported 
as appropriate, and should also be used as an input to the review of the information security risk 
management policy (refer to M2.1.1).
The entity should develop a plan to execute the monitoring and performance measurement 
activities, including all of the topics mentioned in the sub-controls above. It can be helpful to 
have clear responsibilities and schedule to carry out the monitoring and measuring, and there 
should be an independent review function that ensures that this monitoring takes place. 
In addition to executing the monitoring and measurement activities, there is also a need to keep 
these activities up to date and effective, so all monitoring and performance evaluation activities 
should be subject periodical reviews, as well as immediate updates if the situation requires that.
The results of the monitoring and performance evaluation activities should be put into context 
with respect to:
A. The information security policy (refer to M1.2.1)
B. The information security risk management policy (refer to M2.1.1)
C. Management expectations with regards to information security and the overall internal 
context (refer to M1.1.1)

impartiality of the audit process
3) Ensure that the results of the audits are reported to relevant 
management
4) Document the audit program and the audit results
5) Ensure that the internal audit is effectively implemented and 
maintained
The internal audits shall:
6) Be planned, established, implemented and maintained, including the 
frequency, methods, responsibilities, planning requirements, and 
reporting of the internal audits
7) Take account of the importance of the processes concerned and 
the results of previous audits
8) Ensure that entity’s information security conforms to:
A. The entity’s own requirements for information security 
B. The requirements of this Standard
C. Any applicable requirements from the entity’s sector, national or 
regulatory environment
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)  
Critical entities shall also take into account any other NESA’s relevant issuances, guidance, and 
activities in this regard.
Internal audits are another important means, in addition to the performance measurements, 
to assess compliance with the “always applicable” controls of this Standard, the entity’s own 
policies and procedures, and the applicable requirements from the entity’s sector, national or 
regulatory environment.
The information security controls in place at the entity should be subject to independent 
internal audits at a pre-defined schedule.  This type of auditing should not come as a surprise 
but should be planned in advance, and the auditor should provide an audit plan of the areas to 
be audited and people to be met, to ensure the audit does not disrupt the business processes 
more than necessary (see also the sub-controls above).
One of the important concepts of internal audits is the independence of the internal auditor(s) 
carrying out the audits.  If the necessary independence or expertise cannot be found within the 
entity, external resources can provide this service.  If the entity uses external resources, care 
should be taken to ensure that the external resource have enough knowledge of the entity to 
successfully conduct the audit.
Another important aspect of the internal audit is the entity’s reaction to its results.  The results 
of the internal audits should be considered by the Information Security Committee (refer to 
M1.1.2), and it should be ensured that all findings of the audit are corrected in a timely manner.UAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 05  Security Controls

SUB-CONTROLThe entity shall react to the nonconformity when it occurs, and take 
action to control and correct it, and to deal with the consequences.  
The entity shall:
1) Evaluate the need for action to eliminate the causes of nonconformities, 
in order that it does not recur or occur elsewhere, by:
A. Reviewing the nonconformity
B. Determining the causes of the nonconformity
C. Determining if similar nonconformities exist, or could  
potentially occur
2) Implement the appropriate action needed to the effects of the 
encountered nonconformities
3) Review the effectiveness of any corrective action taken
4) Document the corrective actions taken against the nonconformities  
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)  
The entity should have a clear action plan that describes how identified non-conformities will 
be addressed.  This can take place in the Information Security Committee (refer to M1.1.2) and 
should be initiated and controlled by the Information Security Manager. Determine whether 
corrective action is justified on the basis of evaluating the following considerations:
A. Whether it is a first or a repeat occurrence
B. Frequency and history of occurrences (repeated occurrences)
C. Seriousness of the impact
D. Root cause for the non-conformity for which the following activities have to be performed – 
  - Collect data
  - Get expert advice
  - Consult with vendors, partners and associates
The corrective action(s) identified should be implemented within an appropriate timeframe and 
prioritized based on the risk treatment plan (see M2); delays should be avoided to reduce the 
negative effects of non-conformities to the information security in place at the entity. It is also 
important to ensure that the implemented corrective actions achieve their intended objective 
and are effective. The review of the effectiveness of corrective actions can be done by the 
Information Security Committee, and the results should be documented.M6.3 IMPROVEMENT

security controls in place
2) Take account of the performance measurement results and 
incidents when identifying improvements.
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)  
Based on results of monitoring and reviews, decisions should be made on how the information 
security in place, the controls, processes, policies and procedures can be improved. These 
decisions should lead to improvements in the entity’s management of information security and 
its risk management culture.
Continual improvement of information security can be done through the entity’s performance 
indicators and measurements, incident reports, training, reviews and audits (refer to M6.1) and 
the subsequent modification of the entity’s processes, systems, resources, capability and skills.
Continual improvement is a very powerful concept and can help the entity to ensure that its 
information security is up to date and suitable for its needs.

AUTOMATION 
GUIDANCEAs a pre-requisite for any automation to be used, entities should identify 
assets and their owners, and then deciding and documenting which part 
of the entity and/or individuals are responsible for each component of a 
business process (including information, software, and hardware, IT, etc.).
The entity could use a tool to automate the following processes:
• Tracking of information asset inventory,
• Assignment of information assets ownership
• Defining the right use of information assets
Some entities maintain asset inventories using specific large-scale 
commercial products dedicated to the task, or they use free solutions to 
track and then sweep the network periodically for new assets connected to 
it. In particular, when entities acquire new systems, they record the owner 
and features of each new asset, including its network interface Media Access 
Control (MAC) address and location. This mapping of asset attributes and 
owner-to-MAC address can be stored in a free or commercial database 
management system.
The entity should determine which asset attributes, based on entity’s 
needs, should be tracked. The following list of potential attributes could be 
considered:
• Asset name
• Asset type
• Asset tag
• IP address
• MAC address
• Serial number

5) The possibility to be accessed by automated systems to enforce 
specific protections based on the classification level
6) Sufficient information regarding  physical assets (locations, data 
centers, networks, systems, storage, etc.) used to store, process or 
transmit information assets is provided
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)  
Critical entities shall also take into account any other NESA’s relevant issuances, guidance, and 
activities in this regard.
Classifications and associated protective controls for information should take account of 
business needs for sharing or restricting information, as well as legal requirements. Assets 
other than information can also be classified in conformance with classification of information 
which is stored in, processed by or otherwise handled or protected by the asset.
Classification scheme should include conventions for classification and criteria for review of 
the classification over time; in accordance with some predetermined access control policy. The 
level of protection in the scheme should be assessed by analyzing confidentiality, integrity and 
availability and any other requirements for the information considered.
Owners of information assets should be accountable for their classification. The scheme 
should be consistent across the whole entity so that everyone will classify information and 
related assets in the same way, have a common understanding of protection requirements 
and apply the appropriate protection. Each level should be given a name that makes sense in 
the context of the classification scheme’s application. Classification should be included in the 
entity’s processes, and consistent and coherent across the entity. Results of classification 
should indicate value of assets depending on their sensitivity and criticality to the entity, e.g. in 
terms of confidentiality, integrity and availability. Results of classification should be updated in 
accordance with changes of their value, sensitivity and criticality through their life-cycle.

SUB-CONTROLThe entity shall:
1) Establish a procedure for labeling of information and its related 
assets in physical or electronic formats to reflect their attributed 
classification
2) Apply the appropriate label on information
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)  
Procedures for information labeling need to cover information and its related assets in physical 
and electronic formats. The labeling should reflect the classification scheme established in. The 
labels should be easily recognizable. The procedures should give guidance where and how labels 
are attached in consideration of how the information is accessed or the assets are handled 
depending on the types of media. The procedures can define cases where labeling is omitted, 
e.g. labeling of non-confidential information to reduce workloads. Employees and external party 
users should be made aware of labeling procedures.
Output from systems containing information that is classified as being sensitive or critical 
should carry an appropriate classification label in the output.Classification provides people who deal with information a concise indication of how to handle 
and protect it. Creating groups of information with similar protection needs and specifying 
information security procedures that apply to all the information in the group facilitate this. This 
approach reduces the need for case-by-case risk assessment and custom design of controls.
An example of information confidentiality classification scheme could be based on four levels 
as follows:
A) Disclosure causes no harm
B) Disclosure causes minor embarrassment or minor operational inconvenience
C) Disclosure has a significant short term impact on operations or tactical objectives
D) Disclosure has a serious impact on long term strategic objectives or put the survival of the 
organization at risk

F. Clear marking of all copies of media for the attention of the authorized recipient
The classification scheme used within the entity may not be equivalent to the schemes used 
by other entities, even if the names for levels are similar; in addition, information moving 
between entities may vary in classification depending on its context in each entity, even if their 
classification schemes are identical.

A. Media containing confidential information should be stored and disposed of securely and 
safely, e.g. by incineration or shredding, or erased of data for use by another application 
within the entity
B. Procedures should be in place to identify the items that might require secure disposal
C. It may be easier to arrange for all media items to be collected and disposed of securely, 
rather than attempting to separate out the sensitive items
D. Many entities offer collection and disposal services for media; care should be taken in 
selecting a suitable external party with adequate controls and experience
E. Disposal of sensitive items should be logged where possible in order to maintain an  
audit trail
When accumulating media for disposal, consideration should be given to the aggregation 
effect, which may cause a large quantity of non-confidential information to become sensitive.E. To mitigate the risk of media degrading while stored data are still needed, the data should be 
transferred to fresh media before it gets unreadable
F. Multiple copies of valuable data should be stored on separate media to further reduce the 
risk of coincident data damage or loss
G. Registration of removable media should be considered to limit the opportunity for data loss;
H. Prevent content auto-run on laptops, workstations, and servers for removable media
I. Removable media drives should only be enabled if there is a business reason for doing so

3) Implement suitable alternative controls in the case that duties with 
segregation requirements cannot be assigned to different resources
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
Segregation of duties is a method for reducing the risk of accidental or deliberate system 
misuse. Care should be taken that no single person can access, modify or use assets without 
authorization or detection. The initiation of an event should be separated from its authorization. 
The possibility of collusion should be considered in designing the controls.
Small entities may find segregation of duties difficult to achieve, but the principle should be 
applied as far as is possible and practicable. Whenever it is difficult to segregate, other controls 
such as monitoring of activities, audit trails and management supervision should be considered. 
It is important that security audit remains independent.

PERFORMANCE 
INDICATORPercentage of information systems with appropriate and up-to-date

AUTOMATION 
GUIDANCERelying on policy and user action to keep anti-malware tools up to date 
has been widely discredited, as many users have not proven capable of 
consistently handling this task. To ensure anti-virus signatures are up to 
date, entities use automation. They use the built-in administrative features 
of enterprise endpoint security suites to verify that anti-virus, anti-spyware, 
and host-based IDS features are active on every managed system. They run 
automated assessments daily and review the results to find and mitigate 
systems that have deactivated such protections, as well as systems that do 
not have the latest malware definitions.
Some entities deploy free or commercial honeypot and tarpit tools 
to identify attackers in their environment. Security personnel should 
continuously monitor honeypots and tarpits to determine whether traffic 
is directed to them and account logins are attempted. When they identify 
such events, these personnel should gather the source address from 
which this traffic originates and other details associated with the attack for  
follow-on investigation.

Malware includes, for example, viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malware can also 
be encoded in various formats (e.g., UUENCODE, Unicode), contained within compressed or 
hidden files, or hidden in files using steganography.
Protection against malware should be based on malware detection and repair software, security 
awareness, and appropriate system access and change management controls. The following 
guidance should be considered:
A. Establishing a formal policy prohibiting the use of unauthorized software;
B. Establishing a formal policy to protect against risks associated with obtaining files and 
software either from or via external networks, or on any other medium, indicating what 
protective measures should be taken;
C. Conducting regular reviews of the software and data content of systems supporting critical 
business processes; the presence of any unapproved files or unauthorized amendments 
should be formally investigated;
D. Installation and regular update of software that detects and eradicate malware to scan 
computers and media as a precautionary control, or on a routine basis; the checks carried 
out should include:
• Reviewing any files received over networks or via any form of storage medium, for malware 
before use;
• reviewing electronic mail attachments and downloads for malware before use; this check 
should be carried out at different places, e.g. at electronic mail servers, desk top computers 
and when entering the network of the entity;
• Checking web pages for malware;
E. Defining management procedures and responsibilities to deal with malware protection on 
systems, training in their use, reporting and recovering from malware attacks;
F. Preparing appropriate business continuity plans (refer to T9.2.2) for recovering from malware 
attacks, including all necessary data and software backup and recovery arrangements;
G. Implementing procedures to regularly collect information, such as subscribing to mailing 
lists and/or checking web sites giving information about new malware;
H. Implementing procedures to verify information relating to malware, and ensure that warning 
bulletins are accurate and informative; managers should ensure that qualified sources, e.g. 
reputable journals, reliable Internet sites or suppliers producing software protecting against 
malware, are used to differentiate between hoaxes and real malware; all users should be 
made aware of the problem of hoaxes and what to do on receipt of them;
I. Isolate environments where catastrophic impacts may result.
Additional measures can include:
• Monitor workstations, servers, and mobile devices for active, up-to-date anti-malware 
protection with anti-virus, anti-spyware, personal firewalls, and host-based IPS functionality
• Prevent content auto-run on laptops, workstations, and servers
• Scan information systems periodically and files coming from external sources (including

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
Adequate backup systems should be provided to ensure that all essential information and 
software can be recovered following a disaster or media failure.
The following items for information backup should be considered:
A. The necessary level of backup information should be defined;
B. Accurate and complete records of the backup copies and documented restoration 
procedures should be produced;
C. The extent (e.g. full or differential backup) and frequency of backups should reflect the 
business requirements of the entity, the security requirements of the information involved, 
and the criticality of the information to the continued operation of the entity;
D. Backups should be stored in a remote location, at a sufficient distance to escape any 
damage from a disaster at the main site;
E. Backup information should be given an appropriate level of physical and environmental 
protection consistent with these Standards applied at the main site; the controls applied to 
media at the main site should be extended to cover the backup site;
F. Backup media should be regularly tested to ensure that they can be relied upon for 
emergency use when necessary;
G. Restoration procedures should be regularly checked and tested to ensure that they 
are effective and that they can be completed within the time allotted in the operational 
procedures for recovery;
H. In situations where confidentiality is of importance, backups should be protected by means 
of encryption.
Backup arrangements for individual systems should be regularly tested to ensure that they 
meet the requirements of business continuity plans (refer to T9.2.2). For critical systems, the 
backup arrangements should cover all systems information, applications, and data necessary to 
recover the complete system in the event of a disaster.
The retention period for essential business information, and also any requirement for archive 
copies to be permanently retained should be determined.
Once per quarter (or whenever new backup equipment is purchased), a testing team should 
evaluate a random sample of system backups by attempting to restore them on a test bed 
environment. The restored systems should be verified to ensure that the operating system, 
application, and data from the backup are all intact and functional.UAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 05  Security Controls

AUTOMATION 
GUIDANCEMost free and commercial operating systems, network services, and firewall 
technologies offer logging capabilities. Such logging should be activated, 
with logs sent to centralized logging servers. Firewalls, proxies, and remote 
access systems (VPN, dial-up, etc.) should all be configured for verbose 
logging, storing all the information available for logging in the event a follow-
up investigation is required. Furthermore, operating systems, especially 
those of servers, should be configured to create access control logs when 
a user attempts to access resources without the appropriate privileges. 
To evaluate whether such logging is in place, an entity should periodically 
scan through its logs and compare them with the asset inventory in order 
to ensure that each managed item actively connected to the network is 
periodically generating logs.
Analytical programs such as SIM/SEM solutions for reviewing logs 
can provide value, but the capabilities employed to analyze audit 
logs are quite extensive, including, importantly, even just a cursory 
examination by a person. Actual correlation tools can make audit 
logs far more useful for subsequent manual inspection. Such 
tools can be quite helpful in identifying subtle attacks. However, 
these tools are neither a panacea nor a replacement for skilled 
information security personnel and system administrators. Even 
with automated log analysis tools, human expertise and intuition 
are often required to identify and understand attacks.

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
Critical entities shall also take into account any other NESA’s relevant issuances, guidance, and 
activities in this regard (also refer to National Cyber Information Sharing Policy). 
Based on urgency, potential consequences and technical constraints, it may not be possible 
for an entity to validate all information before transmission into the information sharing 
community. Where limitations exist, these should be indicated as part of the message. Also, 
indicating reservations on credibility of information is particularly important where the source 
is anonymous or unknown. It is important to indicate where the originator has been able to 
validate the information given directly, and can vouch for its authenticity.
There are technical mechanisms that can be used to provide authenticity without compromising 
anonymity. For example, shared cryptographic secrets could be used to confirm that a 
communication originated from a member of the community without revealing the actual 
identity of the originator.
Each recipient should be responsible for obtaining any necessary authorizations for wider 
release from the originator prior to onwards distribution.
In inter-sector communications, the originator may not know who all the entities that receive 
the information will be. In such a case, a general or specific sector release approval will need to 
be granted.
In addition, all information sharing communities should define rules for the protection of 
information in transit, and only permit members to join the community if such rules are accepted 
and implemented by the prospective member. Any supporting entity should implement such 
rules internally.
Information sharing communities should consider implementing alternative mechanisms for 
information sharing that do not rely on electronic messaging, and enabling members to specify 
that specific messages are distributed by such other routes.

2) For each group, identify specific segregation requirements
3) Ensure identified segregation requirements are included in the

4) Periodically evaluate the effectiveness of implemented segregation 
strategies and identify areas for improvement
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
One method of controlling the security of large networks is to divide them into separate logical 
network domains, e.g. an entity’s internal network domains and external network domains, 
each protected by a defined security perimeter. A graduated set of controls can be applied 
in different logical network domains to further segregate the network security environments, 
e.g. publicly accessible systems, internal networks, and critical assets. The domains should 
be defined based on a risk assessment and the different security requirements within each of  
the domains.
Such a network perimeter can be implemented by installing a secure gateway between the 
two networks to be interconnected to control access and information flow between the two 
domains. This gateway should be configured to filter traffic between these domains and to block 
unauthorized access in accordance with the entity’s access control policy. An example of this 
type of gateway is what is commonly referred to as a firewall. Another method of segregating 
separate logical domains is to restrict network access by using virtual private networks for user 
groups within the entity.
Networks can also be segregated using the network device functionality, e.g. IP switching. 
Separate domains can then be implemented by controlling the network data flows using the 
routing/switching capabilities, such as access control lists.
The criteria for segregation of networks into domains should be based on the access control 
policy and access requirements, and also take account of the relative cost and performance 
impact of incorporating suitable network routing or gateway technology.
In addition, segregation of networks should be based on the value and classification of 
information stored or processed in the network, levels of trust, or lines of business, in order to 
reduce the total impact of a service disruption.

3) For each wireless network, identify the security controls that should 
be in place based on the required protection level of the information 
services, users, and information systems it supports
4) Periodically evaluate the effectiveness of implemented segregation 
strategies and identify areas for improvement
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
Consideration should be given to the segregation of wireless networks from internal and private 
networks. As the perimeters of wireless networks are not well defined, a risk assessment should 
be carried out in such cases to identify controls (e.g. strong authentication, cryptographic 
methods, and frequency selection) to maintain network segregation.
When designing its wireless networks, the entity should consider the number of base stations 
to be deployed, where they will be situated, what bandwidth limitations should apply to clients 
and what wired alternatives should exist, so as to limit the potential for wireless-based Denial of 
Service attacks.
The use of ‘guest’ wireless networks should be restricted to genuine short-term guests of 
the Entity and consultants without a verified need for connection to the Entity’s core network.  
Guest networks should only connect to the Internet and their data should not transit via the 
Entity’s core network.  Traffic on wireless guest networks should not be terminated on the core 
network and should be tunnelled directly to the network perimeter.
Traffic on guest networks should be monitored by the entity to ensure conformance with 
its acceptable usage provisions.  Temporary users of guest networks should be required to 
authenticate to the network, to avoid opportunistic use of the Entity’s network resources.
Network managers should implement controls to ensure the security of information in wireless. 
In particular, special controls should be established to safeguard the confidentiality and integrity 
of data passing over wireless networks, and to protect the connected systems and applications.
The entity should prohibit and sanction the creation and use of ad-hoc wireless networks, 
including the connecting of unapproved wireless base-stations to the entity’s core  
data network.  
The entity should put in place mechanisms that allow for the identification and isolation of rogue

allocation of privileges controlled through a formal authorization process in accordance with 
the relevant access control policy. The following steps should be considered:
A. Identify privileged access rights associated with each system, e.g. operating system, 
database and application
B. Privileged access rights should:
-  Be allocated to users on a need-to-use basis and on an event-by-event basis in line with 
the access control policy , i.e. the minimum requirement for their functional role only 
when needed
-  Not be granted until the authorization process is complete
-  Be assigned to a different User ID than the User ID used for day to day work. Regular user 
activities should not be performed from privileged accounts
C. An authorization process and a record of all privileges allocated should be maintained;
D. Requirements for expiry of privileged access rights should be defined
E. The competences of users with privileged access rights should be reviewed regularly in 
order to verify if they are in line with their duties
F. Specific procedures should be established and maintained in order to avoid the use of 
generic administration User IDs, according to systems configuration capabilities
G. For generic administration User IDs, the confidentiality of security credentials should 
be maintained when shared (changing them frequently and as soon as possible when a 
privileged user leaves or changes job, communicating them among privileged users with 
appropriate mechanisms)

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
Authentication of remote users can be achieved using, for example, a cryptographic based 
technique, hardware tokens, or a challenge/response protocol. Possible implementations of 
such techniques can be found in various virtual private networks (VPN solutions). Dedicated 
private lines can also be used to provide assurance of the source of connections.
Node authentication can serve as an alternative means of authenticating groups of remote users 
where they are connected to a secure, shared computer facility. Cryptographic techniques, e.g.

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
Routing controls should be based on positive source and destination address checking 
mechanisms.
Managed interfaces include, for example, gateways, routers, firewalls, guards, network-based 
malicious code analysis and virtualization systems, or encrypted tunnels implemented within 
a security architecture (e.g., routers protecting firewalls or application gateways residing on 
protected sub-networks). Sub-networks that are physically or logically separated from internal 
networks are referred to as demilitarized zones or DMZs. Restricting or prohibiting interfaces 
within organizational information systems includes, for example, restricting external web traffic 
to designated web servers within managed interfaces and prohibiting external traffic that 
appears to be spoofing internal addresses.UAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 05  Security Controls

CONTROL The entity shall ensure wireless access is secured.
SUB-CONTROLThe entity shall:
1) Establish usage restrictions, configuration requirements, and 
implementation guidance for wireless access
2) Authorize wireless access to the information system prior to allowing 
such connections
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
Wireless technologies include, for example, microwave, packet radio (UHF/VHF), 802.11x, 
and Bluetooth. Wireless networks use authentication protocols (e.g., EAP/TLS, PEAP), which 
provide credential protection and mutual authentication.
Authentication controls should be implemented to control access to wireless networks. In 
particular, special care is needed in the selection of controls for wireless networks due to the 
greater opportunities for undetected interception and insertion of network traffic.
Entities should consider a number of actions to limit unauthorized use of wireless 
communications outside its boundaries include, for example: 
• Reducing the power of wireless transmissions so that the transmissions are less likely 
to emit a signal that can be used by adversaries outside of the physical perimeters  
of organizations
• Employing measures such as TEMPEST to control wireless emanations
• Using directional/beam forming antennas that reduce the likelihood that unintended 
receivers will be able to intercept signals
Prior to taking such actions, entities can conduct periodic wireless surveys to understand 
the radio frequency profile of its information systems as well as other systems that may be 
operating in the area.

AUTOMATION 
GUIDANCEBuilt-in operating system features can extract lists of accounts with 
super-user privileges, both locally on individual systems and on overall 
domain controllers. To verify that users with high-privileged accounts do 
not use such accounts for day-to-day web surfing and e-mail reading, 
security personnel should periodically gather a list of running processes to 
determine whether any browsers or e-mail readers are running with high 
privileges. Such information gathering can be scripted, with short shell 
scripts searching for a dozen or more different browsers, e-mail readers, 
and document editing programs running with high privileges on machines. 
Some legitimate system administration activity may require the execution 
of such programs over the short term, but long-term or frequent use 
of such programs with administrative privileges could indicate that an

secure log-on and log-off procedure.
SUB-CONTROLThe entity shall:
1) Identify the systems, applications and services that require  
user authentication
2) Classify the identified systems, application and services based on the 
level of protection needed
3) Establish the appropriate log-on and log-off procedures to minimize 
the opportunity for unauthorized access
4) Set a maximum session time for logged on users for sensitive 
systems and applications
5) Terminate inactive sessions after a predefined period of inactivity
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
Even though most applications have secure log-on implemented, a suitable authentication technique 
should be chosen to substantiate the claimed identity of a user. Where strong authentication 
and identity verification is required, authentication methods alternative to passwords, such as 
cryptographic means, smart cards, tokens or biometric means, should be used.
The procedure for logging into a system or application should be designed to minimize the 
opportunity for unauthorized access. The log-on procedure should therefore disclose the minimum 
of information about the system or application, in order to avoid providing an unauthorized user with 
any unnecessary assistance. A good log-on procedure should:
A. Not display system or application identifiers until the log-on process has been  
successfully completed
B. Display a general notice warning that the computer should only be accessed by authorized users
C. Not provide help messages during the log-on procedure that would aid an unauthorized user
D. Validate the log-on information only on completion of all input data. If an error condition arises, 
the system should not indicate which part of the data is correct or incorrect
E. Protect against brute force log-on attempts
F. Log unsuccessful and successful attempts
G. Raise a security event if a potential attempted or successful breach of logon controls is detected;
H. Display the following information on completion of a successful log-on
1- Date and time of the previous successful log-on
2- Details of any unsuccessful log-on attempts since the last successful log-on
I. Not display a password being entered
J. Not transmit passwords in clear text over a network
K. Terminate inactive sessions after a defined period of inactivity, especially in high risk locations 
such as public or external areas outside the entity’s security management or on mobile devices

2) Enable authentication techniques that are suitable to entity
3) Ensure all restricted activity are logged with the associated 
authenticated users
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
This control should be applied for all types of users (including technical support personnel, operators, 
network administrators, system programmers, and database administrators). User IDs should be 
used to trace activities to the responsible individual. Regular user activities should not be performed 
from privileged accounts.
In exceptional circumstances, where there is a clear business benefit, the use of a shared user ID for 
a group of users or a specific job can be used. Approval by management should be documented for 
such cases. Additional controls may be required to maintain accountability.
Generic IDs for use by an individual should only be allowed either where the functions accessible or 
actions carried out by the ID do not need to be traced (e.g. read only access), or where there are 
other controls in place (e.g. password for a generic ID only issued to one staff at a time and logging 
such instance).
Where strong authentication and identity verification is required, authentication methods alternative 
to passwords, such as cryptographic means, smart cards, tokens or biometric means, should  
be used.Connection time controls should be considered for sensitive computer applications, especially 
from high risk locations, e.g. public or external areas that are outside the entity’s security 
management. Examples of such restrictions include:
A. Using predetermined time slots, e.g. for batch file transmissions, or regular interactive 
sessions of short duration
B. Restricting connection times to normal office hours if there is no requirement for overtime 
or extended-hours operation
C. Considering re-authentication at timed intervals
A time-out facility should clear the session screen and also, possibly later, close both application 
and network sessions after a defined period of inactivity. The time-out delay should reflect the 
security risks of the area, the classification of the information being handled and the applications 
being used, and the risks related to the users of the equipment.
A limited form of time-out facility can be provided for some systems, which clear the screen and 
prevents unauthorized access but does not close down the application or network sessions.UAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 05  Security Controls

PERFORMANCE 
INDICATORPercentage of mobile computing equipment (e.g. smart phones, laptops,

access control policy
AUTOMATION 
GUIDANCEWith asset inventory assembled, many entities use tools to pull information 
from network assets such as switches and routers regarding the machines 
connected to the network. Using securely authenticated and encrypted 
network management protocols, tools can retrieve MAC addresses and 
other information from network devices that can be reconciled with the 
entity’s asset inventory of servers, workstations, laptops, and other devices. 
Once MAC addresses are confirmed, switches should implement 802.1x 
and NAC to only allow authorized systems that are properly configured to 
connect to the network.
Going further, effective entities configure free or commercial network 
scanning tools to perform network sweeps on a regular basis, sending 
a variety of different packet types to identify devices connected to the 
network. Before such scanning can take place, entities should verify that 
they have adequate bandwidth for such periodic scans by consulting load 
history and capacities for their networks. In conducting inventory scans, 
scanning tools could send traditional ping packets (ICMP Echo Request) 
looking for ping responses to identify a system at a given IP address. 
Because some systems block inbound ping packets, in addition to traditional 
pings, scanners can also identify devices on the network using transmission 
control protocol (TCP) synchronize (SYN) or acknowledge (ACK) packets. 
Once they have identified IP addresses of devices on the network, some 
scanners provide robust fingerprinting features to determine the operating 
system type of the discovered machine.
In addition to active scanning tools that sweep the network, other asset 
identification tools passively listen on network interfaces looking for devices 
to announce their presence by sending traffic. Such passive tools can be 
connected to switch span ports at critical places in the network to view all 
data flowing through such switches, maximizing the chance of identifying 
systems communicating through those switches.

configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory 
protective software (e.g., malicious code detection, firewall), scanning devices for malicious code, 
updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting 
primary operating system (and possibly other resident software- integrity checks, and disabling 
unnecessary hardware (e.g., wireless, infrared). Entities are cautioned that the need to provide 
adequate security for mobile devices goes beyond the requirements in this control. Many relevant 
safeguards and countermeasures for mobile devices are reflected in the other security controls in 
the catalog allocated in the initial control baselines as starting points for the development of security 
plans and overlays using the tailoring process.
The entity should:
1. Prohibit the use of unclassified mobile devices in facilities containing information systems 
processing, storing, or transmitting classified information unless specifically permitted by the 
authorizing official (See T2.2.5) 
2. Enforce the following restrictions on individuals permitted by the authorizing official to use 
unclassified mobile devices in facilities containing information systems processing, storing, or 
transmitting classified information
1- Connection of unclassified mobile devices to classified information systems is prohibited;
2- Connection of unclassified mobile devices to unclassified information systems requires 
approval from the authorizing official
3- Use of internal or external modems or wireless interfaces within the unclassified mobile 
devices is prohibited
4- Unclassified mobile devices and the information stored on those devices are subject 
to random reviews and inspections by the assignment security officials, and if classified 
information is found, the incident handling policy is followed

3) Ensuring all other cloud security requirements determined relevant 
by the entity are included in the service delivery agreement
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
When establishing service delivery agreement for cloud-based services, it is the entity’s responsibility 
to define security requirements for the cloud vendor.  This should also take into consideration that 
the entity may have different levels of ability to negotiate these terms with a vendor based on the 
type of cloud services being purchased (e.g. private vs. public).
Part of the entity’s responsibility includes understanding, where possible, where information will 
be stored, processed, or transmitted to ensure that often sensitive information privacy laws and 
other legal restrictions (e.g. prohibiting transmission of certain types of information outside national 
borders) are respected.
In addition, the entity should ensure that the terms and conditions of service delivery agreements 
provide ample clarification on how information will be migrated from the selected cloud service 
provider to another provider (or back to the entity) at the termination of the service delivery 
agreement.  This is critical to ensuring that the entity is not “held hostage” by the service provider.UAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 05  Security Controls

2) Be approved by the appropriate business manager or equivalent
3) Address all requirements for security controls identified during the  
risk assessment
4) Outline how to verify that the requirements for security controls have 
been met
5) Be included in the statement of business and technical requirements
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
Information security requirements should be identified using various methods such as regulations 
and policies, reviews threat modeling and vulnerability thresholds/vulnerably remediation. Results 
from the identification should be documented merging views of all stakeholders.
Security requirements and controls should reflect the business value of the information involved and 
the potential negative business impact which might result from lack of adequate security.
System requirements for information security and processes for implementing security should be 
integrated in the early stages of information system projects. Controls introduced at the design 
stage are significantly cheaper to implement and maintain than those included during or after 
implementation.
The sizing of information systems should take into account enabling all security features in that 
system; i.e. higher specifications model of Security-Systems so that when security features are 
enabled they do not cause slow-down and degradation in the information systems performance. 
For applications systems providing services or transferring information over public networks, the 
system requirements should also consider the following:
A. The level of confidence each party requires in each other’s claimed identity, e.g. through 
authentication
B. Authorization processes associated with who may approve contents of, issuing or signing key 
transactional documents
C. Ensuring that communicating partners are fully informed of their authorizations for provision or 
use of the service
D. Determining and meeting requirements for confidentiality, integrity, proof of dispatch and 
receipt of key documents and the non-repudiation of contracts, e.g. associated with tendering 
and contract processes
E. The level of trust required in the integrity of key documents
F. The confidentiality of any confidential information
G. The confidentiality and integrity of any order transactions, payment information, delivery 
address details and confirmation of receipts
H. The degree of verification appropriate to verify payment information supplied by a customer
I. Selecting the most appropriate settlement form of payment to guard against fraudUAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 05  Security Controls

L. Liability associated with any fraudulent transactions;
M. Insurance requirements;
N. Transaction related requirements such as authenticity, confidentiality and integrity of transaction 
related data, non-repudiation and protection of any transaction related data.
If products are acquired, a formal testing and acquisition process should be followed. Contracts with 
the supplier should address the identified security requirements. Where the security functionality in a 
proposed product does not satisfy the specified requirement then the risk introduced and associated 
controls should be reconsidered prior to purchasing the product.
Available guidance for security configuration of the product aligned with the final software / service stack 
of that system should be evaluated and implemented.
Criteria for accepting products should be defined e.g., in terms of their functionality, which give assurance 
that the identified security requirements are met. Products should be evaluated against these criteria 
before acquisition. Where additional functionality is supplied and causes a security risk, this should be 
disabled or the proposed control structure should be reviewed to determine if advantage can be taken of 
the enhanced functionality available.

regulations and national restrictions that might apply to the use of cryptographic techniques in 
different parts of the world and to the issues of trans-border flow of encrypted information.
Cryptographic controls can be used to achieve different security objectives, e.g.:
CONFIDENTIALITY:  using encryption of information to protect sensitive or critical information, 
either stored or transmitted
INTEGRITY/AUTHENTICITY:  using digital signatures or message authentication codes to protect 
the authenticity and integrity of stored or transmitted sensitive or critical information
NON-REPUDIATION:  using cryptographic techniques to obtain proof of the occurrence or non-
occurrence of an event or action
Cryptographic techniques can also be used to implement the dissemination rules of information 
sharing, e.g. through information rights management.UAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 05  Security Controls

217T7.4.2 KEY MANAGEMENTPRIORITY P2
APPLICABILITYBASED ON RISK 
ASSESSMENT
CONTROLThe entity shall establish key management to support the entity’s use of 
cryptographic techniques.
SUB-CONTROLThe entity shall: 
1) Develop a key management policy and process to control the   
generation of keys taking into account NESA’s issuances with regard to 
key management
2) Define key storing standards
3) Define procedures to revoke/block keys and to repair damage or 
corrupted keys
4) Protect all cryptographic keys against modification and loss
5) Protect secret and private keys against unauthorized use and disclosure
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
All cryptographic keys should be protected against modification, loss, and destruction. In addition, 
secret and private keys need protection against unauthorized disclosure. Equipment used to 
generate, store and archive keys should be physically protected.
A key management system should be based on an agreed set of standards, procedures, and secure 
methods for:
A. Generating keys for different cryptographic systems and different applications
B. Generating and obtaining public key certificates
C. Distributing keys to intended users, including how keys should be activated when received
d. Storing keys, including how authorized users obtain access to keys
E. Changing or updating keys including rules on when keys should be changed and how this will  
be done
F. Dealing with compromised keys
G. Revoking keys including how keys should be withdrawn or deactivated, e.g. when keys have been 
compromised or when a user leaves an entity (in which case keys should also be archived)
H. Recovering keys that are lost or corrupted as part of business continuity management, e.g. for 
recovery of encrypted information
I. Archiving keys, e.g. for information archived or backed up
J. Destroying keys
K. Logging and auditing of key management related activities
In order to reduce the likelihood of compromise, activation, and deactivation dates for keys should 
be defined so that the keys can only be used for a limited period of time. This period of time should 
be dependent on the circumstances under which the cryptographic control is being used, and the 
perceived risk.
In addition to securely managing secret and private keys, the authenticity of public keys should 
also be considered. This authentication process can be done using public key certificates which 
are normally issued by a certification authority, which should be a recognized entity with suitable 
controls and procedures in place to provide the required degree of trust.
The contents of service level agreements or contracts with external suppliers of cryptographic 
services, e.g. with a certification authority, should cover issues of liability, reliability of services and 
response times for the provision of services.UAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 05  Security Controls

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
The use of operational databases containing personal information or any other sensitive information 
for testing purposes should be avoided. If personal or otherwise sensitive information is used for 
testing purposes, all sensitive details and content should be removed or modified beyond recognition 
before use. The following guidelines should be applied to protect operational data, when used for 
testing purposes:
A. The access control procedures, which apply to operational application systems, should also 
apply to test application systems
B. There should be separate authorization each time operational information is copied to a test 
application system
C. Operational information should be erased from a test application system immediately after the 
testing is complete
D. The copying and use of operational information should be logged to provide an audit trailVendor supplied software used in operational systems should be maintained at a level supported by 
the supplier. Over time, software vendors will cease to support older versions of software. The entity 
should consider the risks of relying on unsupported software.
Any decision to upgrade to a new release should take into account the business requirements for 
the change, and the security of the release, i.e. the introduction of new security functionality or the 
number and severity of security problems affecting this version. Software patches should be applied 
when they can help to remove or reduce security weaknesses.
Physical or logical access should only be given to suppliers for support purposes when necessary, 
and with management approval. The supplier’s activities should be monitored. Computer software 
may rely on externally supplied software and modules, which should be monitored and controlled to 
avoid unauthorized changes, which could introduce security weaknesses.UAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 05  Security Controls

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
Formal change control procedures should be documented and enforced in order to minimize the 
corruption of information systems. Introduction of new systems and major changes to existing 
systems should follow a formal process of documentation, specification, testing, quality control, and 
managed implementation.
This process should include a risk assessment, analysis of the impacts of changes, and specification 
of security controls needed. This process should also ensure that existing security and control 
procedures are not compromised, that support programmers are given access only to those parts 
of the system necessary for their work, and that formal agreement and approval for any change is 
obtained.
Wherever practicable, application and operational change control procedures should be integrated. 
The change procedures should include:
A. Maintaining a record of agreed authorization levels
B. Ensuring changes are submitted by authorized users
C. Reviewing controls and integrity procedures to ensure that they will not be compromised by  
the changes
D. Identifying all software, information, database entities, and hardware that require amendment
E. Obtaining formal approval for detailed proposals before work commences

be considered:
A. The risk of built-in controls and integrity processes being compromised
B. Whether the consent of the vendor should be obtained
C. The possibility of obtaining the required changes from the vendor as standard program updates
D. The impact if the entity becomes responsible for the future maintenance of the software as a 
result of changes
If changes are necessary the original software should be retained and the changes applied to a clearly 
identified copy. A software update management process should be implemented to ensure the 
most up-to-date approved patches and application updates are installed for all authorized software. 
All changes should be fully tested and documented, so that they can be reapplied if necessary to

OBJECTIVETo reduce risks resulting from exploitation of published or identified technical 
vulnerabilities
PERFORMANCE 
INDICATORPercentage of identified vulnerabilities mitigated within the acceptable 
time periods as defined in security requirements
AUTOMATION 
GUIDANCEA large number of vulnerability scanning tools are available to evaluate 
the security configuration of systems. Some entities have also found 
commercial services using remotely managed scanning appliances to be 
effective. To help standardize the definitions of discovered vulnerabilities in 
multiple departments of an entity or even across entities it is preferable to 
use vulnerability scanning tools that measure security flaws and map them 
to vulnerabilities and issues categorized using one or more of the following 
industry-recognized vulnerability, configuration, and platform classification 
schemes and languages: CVE, CCE, OVAL, CPE, CVSS, and/or XCCDF.
Advanced vulnerability scanning tools can be configured with user credentials 
to log in to scanned systems and perform more comprehensive scans 
than can be achieved without login credentials. The frequency of scanning 
activities, however, should increase as the diversity of an entity’s systems 
increases to account for the varying patch cycles of each vendor.
In addition to the scanning tools that check for vulnerabilities and 
misconfigurations across the network, various free and commercial tools 
can evaluate security settings and configurations of local machines on 
which they are installed. Such tools can provide fine-grained insight into 
unauthorized changes in configuration or the inadvertent introduction of 
security weaknesses by administrators.
Effective entities link their vulnerability scanners with problem-ticketing 
systems that automatically monitor and report progress on fixing problems, 
and that make unmitigated critical vulnerabilities visible to higher levels of 
management to ensure the problems are solved.
The most effective vulnerability scanning tools compare the results of the 
current scan with previous scans to determine how the vulnerabilities in the 
environment have changed over time. Security personnel use these features 
to conduct vulnerability trending from month to month.
As vulnerabilities related to unpatched systems are discovered by scanning 
tools, security personnel should determine and document the amount of 
time that elapses between the public release of a patch for the system and 
the occurrence of the vulnerability scan. If this time window exceeds the 
entity’s benchmarks for deployment of the given patch’s criticality level, 
security personnel should note the delay and determine if a deviation was 
formally documented for the system and its patch. If not, the security team 
should work with management to improve the patching process.
Additionally, some automated patching tools may not detect or install certain 
patches due to error by the vendor or administrator. Because of this, all patch 
checks should reconcile system patches with a list of patches each vendor 
has announced on its website.UAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 05  Security Controls

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
As a prerequisite, a current and complete inventory of assets is needed (including software vendor, 
version numbers, current state of deployment, and the person(s) within the entity responsible for 
the software).
The following guidance should be followed to establish an effective management process for 
technical vulnerabilities:
A. The entity should define and establish the roles and responsibilities associated with technical 
vulnerability management, including vulnerability monitoring, vulnerability risk assessment (see 
M2.2), patching, asset tracking, and any coordination responsibilities required
B. The entity should identify information resources that will be used to identify relevant technical 
vulnerabilities and to maintain awareness about them should be identified for software and other 
technology (based on the asset inventory list); these information resources should be updated 
based on changes in the inventory, or when other new or useful resources are found
C. The entity should define a timeline to react to notifications of potentially relevant  
technical vulnerabilities
D. The entity should identify the risks associated to potential technical vulnerability and the 
actions to be taken; such action could involve patching of vulnerable systems and/or applying  
other controls
E. Depending on how urgently a technical vulnerability needs to be addressed, the action taken 
should be carried out according to the controls related to change management or by following 
information security incident response procedures

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
The use of acquisition and procurement processes by entities early in the system development 
life cycle provides an important vehicle to protect the supply chain. Entities use available all-source 
intelligence analysis to inform the tailoring of acquisition strategies, tools, and methods. There are 
a number of different tools and techniques available (e.g., obscuring the end use of an information 
system or system component, using blind or filtered buys). Entities also consider creating incentives 
for suppliers who:
A. Implement required security controls
B. Promote transparency into their organizational processes and security practices
C. Provide additional vetting of the processes and security practices of subordinate suppliers, 
critical information system components, and services
D. Restrict purchases from specific suppliers or countries
E. Provide contract language regarding the prohibition of tainted or counterfeit components
In addition, entities consider minimizing the time between purchase decisions and required delivery 
to limit opportunities for adversaries to corrupt information system components or products. 
Finally, entities can use trusted/controlled distribution, delivery, and warehousing options to reduce 
supply chain risk (e.g., requiring tamper-evident packaging of information system components

7) Define roles, responsibilities, and the corresponding authority
8) Document the workflow
9) Develop policies and corresponding procedures
10) Announce the CSIRT when it becomes operational to create the 
appropriate level of awareness
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
Critical entities shall also take into account any other NESA’s relevant issuances, guidance, and 
activities in this regard (also refer to National Cyber Response Framework). 
Entities should identify members in the entity to form the proper CSIRT. The establishment of 
the team should take place before developing the Incident Response plan. One of the CSIRT’s 
responsibilities is to create the IR Plan. 
Here are some of the CSIRT members:
• Team leader who is usually a senior manager whose responsibility is to take charge of incidents 
and direct actions to other team members
• Boundary protection experts. Normally individuals that are expert in firewalls, routers and IDSs 
that sits at the edge of the network.B. Make the incident response plan available to defined incident response personnel (identified 
by name and/or by role- and organizational elements;
C. Review and test the incident response plan in defined frequency;
D. Update the incident response plan to address system/organizational changes or problems 
encountered during plan implementation, execution, or testing;
E. Communicate incident response plan changes to defined incident response personnel 
(identified by name and/or by role) and organizational elements; and
F. Protect the incident response plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.
It is important that entities develop and implement a coordinated approach to incident 
response. Organizational missions, business functions, strategies, goals, and objectives for 
incident response help to determine the structure of incident response capabilities. As part of a 
comprehensive incident response capability, entities consider the coordination and sharing of 
information with external entities, including, for example, external service providers and entities 
involved in the supply chain for organizational information systems.UAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 05  Security Controls

236• Network administrators
• Physical security members
• Human resources might be involved if the attach was originated by an employee
• Communication might be involved to become the public face for incidents that  
became public.  
Here are some of the primary responsibilities of the CSIRT:
• Develop incident policy, plan, and procedures
• Response to incidents and minimizing the impact
• Investigate incidents and determine the cause 
• prevent future incident by recommending security controls
• Handle incident reporting and communication to all stakeholder involved internally

ASSESSMENT
CONTROL The entity shall assess and classify information security incidents.
SUB-CONTROLThe entity shall:
1) Establish an incident classification scheme in line with the incident 
response policy taking into account NESA’s issuances with regard to 
incident management 
2) Assess and identify the incidents that should be reported at the 
sector and national level
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
Classification and prioritization of incidents can help to identify the impact and extent of an 
incident. A point of contact should assess the information security events using the agreed 
information security event and incident classification scale and decide whether the events 
should be classified as information security incidents.
In case where the entity has CSIRT, the assessment and decision can be forwarded to the CSIRT 
for confirmation or reassessment. Results of the assessment and decision should be recorded 
in detail for the purpose of future reference and verification.
An attack is classified as an incident if the attack is directed against information assets, has 
a realistic chance of success and threatens the confidentiality, integrity and availability of 
information resources and assets.
An indication of an incident can be one or more of the following:
• If dormant or inactive accounts started accessing system resources, querying servers, or 
engaged in other activities
 • If modification of logs occurs and the systems administrator cannot determine explicitly the 
authorized individual who modified them
• Presence of hacking tools
• Notifications by partner or peer
• Notification by the attackerUAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 05  Security Controls

2) Ensure that the program covers all incident response procedures as 
well as their users
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
In designing the incident response training, entities should customize the content and level of 
details based on the targeted audience to allow attendees to focus on the information that is 
relevant to them.
As such, end users may only need to identify an incident or suspicious activities and call the 
right contact, system administrators may require technical training on how to handle/remediate 
incidents, and incident responders may receive more specific training on forensics, reporting, 
system recovery, and restoration.

SUB-CONTROLThe entity shall:
1) Establish detailed incident records including all related activities and 
outcomes where applicable
2) Develop lessons learned and where applicable identify additional 
controls to avoid similar incidents in the future
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
There should be mechanisms in place to enable the types, volumes, costs, and impacts of 
information security incidents to be quantified and monitored. The information gained from the 
evaluation of information security incidents should be used to identify recurring or high impact 
incidents and inform risk assessment and risk treatment activities.
Investigations based on information distributed by an information sharing community should 
be performed, to reduce the risks of similar incidents and develop a better understanding of 
the risks facing the community and any related significant information infrastructures. Such 
investigations could be performed by the community members involved, or by a supporting 
entity, if one exists.
Following reported incidents, post incident reviews should be performed by members of the 
information sharing community to trigger updates to security incident response plans, related 
procedures and the business risk profile, and implementation of additional controls even if 
the member was not affected by the incident in question. Each member should ensure that 
reported incident responses are assessed, and any lessons or possible improvements to 
the member’s own processes are identified and acted upon to continuously improve its own

SUB-CONTROLThe entity shall:
1) Identify the requirements of the applicable jurisdictions
2) Establish procedures for collecting evidence taking into account :
• Chain of custody
• Safety of evidence
• Safety of the personnel
• Roles and responsibilities of personnel involved
• Competency of the personnel
• Documentation
• Briefing
• Other identified requirements
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
Internal procedures should be developed and followed when dealing with evidence for the 
purposes of disciplinary and legal action. 
Identification is the process involving the search for, recognition and documentation of 
potential evidence. Collection is the process of gathering the physical items that can contain 
potential evidence. Acquisition is the process of creating a copy of data within a defined set. 
Preservation is the process to maintain and safeguard the integrity and original condition of the 
potential evidence.
In general, the procedures for evidence should provide processes of identification, collection, 
acquisition and preservation in accordance with different types of media, devices and status of 
devices, e.g., powered on or off. The procedures should take account of:
A Chain of custody
B Safety of evidence
C Safety of the personnel
D Roles and responsibilities of personnel involved
E Competency of the personnel
F Documentation
G Briefing
Where available, certification or other relevant means of qualification of personnel and tools 
should be sought, so as to strengthen the value of the preserved evidence.
Forensic evidence may transcend organizational or jurisdictional boundaries. In such cases, 
it should be ensured that the entity is entitled to collect the required information as forensic 
evidence. The requirements of different jurisdictions should also be considered to maximize 
chances of admission across the relevant jurisdictions.UAE Information Assurance Standard Chapter 05  Security Controls

PERFORMANCE 
INDICATORPercentage of information security incidents reported within the required  
time frame per applicable incident category as defined in the information 
security incident management  policy
AUTOMATION 
GUIDANCEFor an automated identification of weaknesses, a large number of 
vulnerability scanning tools are available. Some enterprises have also 
found commercial services using remotely managed scanning appliances 
to be effective. To help standardize the definitions of discovered 
vulnerabilities in multiple departments of an entity or even across entities, 
it is preferable to use vulnerability scanning tools that measure security 
flaws and map them to vulnerabilities and issues categorized using one 
or more of the following industry-recognized vulnerability, configuration, 
and platform classification schemes and languages: CVE, CCE, OVAL, 
CPE, CVSS, and/or XCCDF.
Advanced vulnerability scanning tools can be configured with 
user credentials to log in to scanned systems and perform more 
comprehensive scans than can be achieved without login credentials. The 
frequency of scanning activities, however, should increase as the diversity 
of an entity’s systems increases to account for the varying patch cycles 
of each vendor.
Also, event log collectors and incident management systems should be 
considered. These technologies provide log collection, normalization, 
correlation and analysis: they can be very helpful both to detect incidents 
in their early stages and to investigate incidents.

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
A security weakness (or vulnerability) is a flow which allows an attacker to reduce a system’s 
information assurance.
All employees, contractors and external party users should report these matters to the 
point of contact as quickly as possible in order to prevent information security incidents. The 
reporting mechanism should be as easy, accessible and available as possible. They should be 
informed that they should not, in any circumstances, attempt to prove a suspected weakness. 
Testing weaknesses might be interpreted as a potential misuse of the system and could also 
cause damage to the information system or service and result in legal liability for the individual 
performing the testing.Situations to be considered for information security event reporting include:
A. Ineffective security control
B. Breach of information integrity, confidentiality or availability expectations

245IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY)
Critical entities shall also take into account any other NESA’s relevant issuances, guidance, and 
activities in this regard. 
An entity should determine whether the continuity of information security is captured within 
the BCM process or within the (IT) disaster recovery management (DRM- process. Information 
security requirements should be determined when planning for business continuity and disaster 
recovery.
In the absence of formal business continuity and disaster recovery planning, information 
security management should assume that information security requirements remain the same 
in adverse situations, compared to normal operational conditions. Alternatively, an organization 
could perform a business impact analysis (BIA- for information security aspects to determine 
the information security requirements applicable to adverse situations.
The process of including information security in the business continuity management should 
bring together the following key elements of business continuity management:
A. Understanding the risks the entity is facing in terms of likelihood and impact in time, including 
an identification and prioritization of critical business processes
B. Identifying all the assets involved in critical business processes
C. Understanding the impact which interruptions caused by information security incidents 
are likely to have on the business (it is important that solutions are found that will handle 
incidents causing smaller impact, as well as serious incidents that could threaten the viability 
of the entity), and establishing the business objectives of information systems
D. Considering the purchase of suitable insurance which may form part of the overall business 
continuity process, as well as being part of operational risk management
E. Identifying and considering the implementation of additional preventive and mitigating controls
F. Identifying sufficient financial, organizational, technical, and environmental resources to 
address the identified information security requirements
G. Ensuring the safety of personnel and the protection of information systems and 
organizational property
The process should bring together the following key elements of business  
continuity management:
A. Formulating and documenting business continuity plans addressing information security 
requirements in line with the agreed business continuity strategy;
B. Regular testing and updating of the plans and processes put in place;
C. Ensuring that the management of business continuity is incorporated in the entity’s

the specific recovery plan. The results of tests should be recorded and actions taken to improve 
the plans, where necessary.
Responsibility should be assigned for regular reviews of each business continuity plan. The 
identification of changes in business arrangements not yet reflected in the business continuity 
plans should be followed by an appropriate update of the plan. This formal change control 
process should ensure that the updated plans are distributed and reinforced by regular reviews 
of the complete plan.
Examples of changes where updating of business continuity plans should be considered are 
acquisition of new equipment, upgrading of systems and changes in:
• Personnel
• Addresses or telephone numbers
• Business strategy
• Location, facilities, and resources
• Legislation
• Contractors, suppliers, and key customers
• Processes, or new or withdrawn ones

SUMMARY OF THE PRIORITIZED CONTROLS
The following table provides a list of the prioritized security controls. As a recap, the concept of 
“Prioritization” relates to grouping the security controls in order of importance for realizing a minimum 
level of information assurance protection, and for enabling a phased and incremental implementation of 
this Standard.
Overall, the distribution of security controls across the four priority levels is outlined in Table 6, and the 
detailed listing is provided in Table 7, below.

MAPPING OF THREATS TO CONTROLS
The following table provides examples of typical threats along with their mitigating controls. The list of 
threats types are aggregated from benchmark risk registers and mapped to mitigating controls to assist 
implementing entities during their risk assessment process. 
Overall, a number of security controls are needed to mitigate specific threat types given the complex 
nature of the threats. As such, threat types along with their corresponding mitigating controls are outlined 
in Table 9 below.

SECTOR AND NATIONAL LEVEL CONTROLS
The following table provides a list of the sector and national level security controls. As a recap, sector and 
national level controls are designed to overcome the silos created by a single-entity approach to IA, and 
hence create a stronger and more integrated approach for national information assurance. They serve 
as foundational elements for developing the sector and national views of IA by enabling the integration 
and analysis of information relating to security threats, risks and incidents, as well as the state of these 
Standards implementation and risk assessment outcomes. 
Overall, the UAE IA Standards provides a total of 15 sector and national level controls as outlined in Table 
10 below.
